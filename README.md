Archiving and transforming community documentation notes into a memex

## Concept

**Organizational challenges**
- meetings are at a weekly or bi-weekly cadence
- we often only pay attention to previous meetup notes
- discord / zoom calls all sorta look / feel the same
- we are bombarded with URLs that they become easy to forget
- every URL / tab is sorta silo'd from each other in terms of context switching
  - It'd be nice if we can see multiple pages in one place (like on an infinite canvas)

**Questions**
- How can we visualize our activities and bigger picture better?
  - How can new people see a high level overview of past 5 meetups?
- How can we streamline the process for organizations to have a longer memory?

## Notes
PDFs over 100 MB are automatically added to .gitignore (Uploaded to Discord though)
