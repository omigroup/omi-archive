Our members include businesses and individuals working towards this common goal.\r\n\r\nIf youâ€™re an observer or here for the first time, this is a meeting where people who work on the OMI group initiatives discuss updates and contribution opportunities for current projects and goals. This is your chance to jump in and help!\r\n\r\nWe welcome you to introduce yourself in the ðŸ”ˆ omi-weekly-meeting chat as we dive into the agenda items. There will be an open floor in the last 15 minutes of the meeting (agenda permitting) where we can discuss any items you feel are relevant to the current or near future OMI goals.\r\n\r\nAgenda:\r\n\r\n1.   \"420\".\r\n2. Oopsie! where is last week's meeting? (Link below but not visible in the [discussions page](https://github.com/omigroup/omigroup/discussions))? Is this a bug or did a lot happen in the backlog refinement?\r\n3. Feedback on metatraversal\r\n4. Feedback on OMI demo day \"interoperable physics in the open metaverse\"\r\n5. Monthly OMI demo days: schedule and take ownership. [Hackmd ](https://hackmd.io/@indiebio/OMI-monthly-demo-days)for scheduling and [discussion thread on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/770382203782692945/1149030210503716944).\r\n6. Weekly game nights? \r\n  e.g. foosball, darts, card games, and beanbags, and a little movie theatre where we show movies. Then we meet there, like a clubhouse, once a week. No agenda, just chillin' together. Maybe in VR chat?\r\n7. Elections.\r\nThere will be elections for OMI chairs. MrMetaverse is up for re-election, indiebio has nominated herself for election.\r\nNominations will be open until <date>\r\nElection will be on <date>\r\nMore info on roles of Chairs https://hackmd.io/@mrmetaverse/omi-tasks-audit; \r\nalso: https://github.com/omigroup/omigroup/discussions/157\r\nand https://github.com/omigroup/omigroup/discussions/165\r\n8. EU research funding cycle open. Do a demo day to see what is out there, match up with people? [Thread on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/770382203782692945/1158355479349702686)\r\n9. Question in Discord about \"[different implementations of metaverse engines](https://discord.com/channels/770382203782692945/895065600353792081/1158043241158029402)\" - this could be a great demo day topic as well? Or some sort of a thing. Like a youtube debate.\r\n10. OMF collaboration ... should we try work this? As a separate but closely aligned partner, perhaps the commercial side to OMI's grassroots community? \r\n10.1. Where should OMF focus on (e.g. what working groups)\r\n10.2 Where should the closest collaboration between  OMF and OMI be?\r\n11.

This may cause us to lose track of projects. We could explicitly state \"We haven't seen any progress on the OMI place to meet, work, and hang, in about 4 weeks. So I am de-prioritizing #44 from active, to the backlog.\" And when a new topic gets added, we would explicitly state \"We recently accepted proposal #49 and are moving this to active\". \r\n\r\nThat way when new topics are introduced we can ensure they are tracked/trackable. And when old topics fall to the wayside, we don't forget about them later. \r\n\r\nI am suggesting 5-10 min at the beginning or end of our Wednesday all-hands meetings. \r\n\r\nThoughts?

So for the gltf working group, or the upcoming stellar mesh working group, I recommend we draft working agreements that fit each teams. For example, we may have a working group consist mainly of people in Europe and they may want to establish standard working hours, or a standard toolset for workshops, etc. \r\n- Working agreements help strengthen team dynamics, and provide a psychologically safe place for all to participate. \r\n- Working agreements are also ideal for establish ceremony cadence, i.e. if your team wants to follow Scrum, you may want to establish a daily standup meeting time, a demo day, and a backlog refinement. But if your team doesn't want to use scrum, you may want to establish kanban or some other method of sharing and tracking work. \r\n- The most important part is that we should know how work gets done, how to get involved, and how to respect each other. \r\n- "},{"id":"MDE3OkRpc2N1c3Npb25Db21tZW50MTE1OTUzNw==","author":{"login":"mrmetaverse"},"body":"Notes for todays session are started here on [hackmd](https://hackmd.io/@mrmetaverse/omi-081121)"}]},"labels":{"nodes":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMzM2MTIxOTU0","name":"Consistently deliver value","color":"1B9AAA","description":"We incrementally discover and deliver  value with intent"}]}}]}}}}
