We were able to get the GLTF physics issue on the agenda, and the discussion went really well. \r\n-- We presented the [GLTF physics page](https://github.com/omigroup/omigroup/discussions/393) which features a table that compares OMI vs MSFT specs and helps distill the most relevant points. (Special thanks to @aaronfranke and [IndieBio](https://twitter.com/indiebio) for page content.) \r\nShort link to this page: https://bit.ly/gltfstandard\r\n-- The goal is to get more voices and feedback in the mix. We (IndieBio, funksoup & aaronfranke) will follow up with emails to specific mail lists.\r\n\r\n- REMINDER: There is a board election coming up - it's important that we/OMI have a representative on the MSF board, so we can continue to be a voice for independent creators, small orgs, open source and community/grassroots orgs. Elections will be in a few weeks but we can start preparing our community for that now. (There are some documents we will need to fill out). **We want to put one of us on the board (i.e. @funksoup)**. \r\n\r\n\r\nMedia group: \r\n\r\n\r\nGLTF group:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWORLD HOPS:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","author":{"login":"funksoup"},"comments":{"nodes":[]},"labels":{"nodes":[]}},{"id":"D_kwDOFUbqUM4AT8u1","category":{"name":"Constellation of Standards"},"upvoteCount":2,"updatedAt":"2023-05-25T01:26:31Z","createdAt":"2023-05-24T16:44:55Z","number":393,"title":"GLTF Physics Standard","body":"**Short link to this page: https://bit.ly/gltfstandard**\r\n\r\nWe are at risk of a limiting, confusing standard becoming the default for glTF physics. There are currently two competing glTF physics standards, OMI and MSFT.\r\n\r\nPlease add your voice and input to make sure the best standard gets accepted. Ideally we would like this [Khronos PR](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/pull/2258) be merged.\r\n\r\n**Why this is a big deal:**\r\nOMI's specs are designed to be portable between engines, the specs include tables and other information that details how to convert the physics information to several game engines. Engines without dedicated character/vehicle types just use kinematic/rigid, but the distinction helps engines that do have dedicated types/modes like Godot and Unreal. MSFT's specs tend to align closely with how Unity works, such as the isKinematic boolean. This risks an unclear, non-portable standard.\r\n\r\n**Summary of OMI spec compared to MSFT spec:**\r\n\r\n| Item | OMI spec | MSFT spec |\r\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\r\n| Collider shape definition    | String for the type (similar to how the official KHR_lights_punctual extension works)    | different key names each with sub-JSON    |\r\n| Type of body definition   | Text String for the type (similar to how the official KHR_lights_punctual extension works)     | `isKinematic` boolean    |\r\n|[ Type of body categories ](https://github.com/eoineoineoin/glTF_Physics/issues/4)    |Kinematic, rigid, static, character, vehicle, trigger bodies     | Kinematic, not kinematic    |\r\n| Joints definition | Defined on a separate spec that combines for a larger standard | Defined as a required part of the rigid body spec | \r\n| Materials definition | Defined on a separate spec and is optional on the body | Defined on the rigid body spec and is required (otherwise the body is a non-solid trigger) |\r\n| Trigger definition      | Explicitly defined on either body or collider level. Allows implementations to only implement OMI_collider, with non-solid objects staying non-solid | Defines a trigger as a body without a physics material   |\r\n\r\nRead more about the specific issues: https://github.com/eoineoineoin/glTF_Physics/issues\r\n\r\n**More information:**\r\nOMI physics (OMI_collider and OMI_physics_body) https://github.com/omigroup/gltf-extensions/tree/main/extensions/2.0\r\nKhronos discussion: \r\nKhronos PR regarding OMI physics https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/pull/2258\r\nKhronos PR regarding MSFT physics https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/pull/2257 \r\nMSFT physics (MSFT_CollisionPrimitives and MSFT_RigidBodies) https://github.com/eoineoineoin/glTF_Physics\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to @aaronfranke and [IndieBio](https://twitter.com/indiebio) for content above.\r\n","author":{"login":"funksoup"},"comments":{"nodes":[]},"labels":{"nodes":[{"id":"LA_kwDOFUbqUM8AAAABSkhOBA","name":"gltf","color":"7A9AA4","description":""}]}},{"id":"D_kwDOFUbqUM4AT8s3","category":{"name":"General"},"upvoteCount":1,"updatedAt":"2023-05-24T17:05:32Z","createdAt":"2023-05-24T16:07:10Z","number":392,"title":"05/24/2023 Weekly Meeting 108 Notes/Agenda","body":"Weekly Meeting 108 is happening on Wednesday, May 24, 2023 from 9:00 AM PST (16:00 UTC) - 10:00 AM PST (17:00 UTC)\r\n\r\nYou can add it to your calendar [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/1?cid=Y18wZHB1Z2Y5ZjgzZXE0cWVrbWI2b21xYmptZ0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t).\r\n \r\nWe'll be meeting again in the omi-weekly-meeting channel of the [AngellXR/OMI Discord](https://discord.gg/NJtT9grz5E).\r\nWe regularly use the # omi-meeting-chat channel for text chat. \r\n\r\n## Who we are and why we're here:\r\n\r\nThe Open Metaverse Interoperability Group (OMI) is focused on bridging virtual worlds by designing and promoting protocols for identity, social graphs, inventory, and more.
