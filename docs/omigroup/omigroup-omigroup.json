Also, what do you think of a Metaverse Prom? Like what if we bring a date/friend to Prom. Maybe it's someone who we want to pull-in to our world. Maybe it's someone who already builds in the Metaverse. Would be cool to see something like a metaverse prom where we call-in others to be part of our community. \r\n- Metaverse Festival October 2024 see [HackMD draft information for page on OMI website to start spreading the word](https://hackmd.io/@indiebio/metaverse-float-parade)\r\n","author":{"login":"mrmetaverse"},"comments":{"nodes":[]},"labels":{"nodes":[]}},{"id":"D_kwDOFUbqUM4AU_x5","category":{"name":"General"},"upvoteCount":1,"updatedAt":"2023-08-09T18:46:43Z","createdAt":"2023-08-09T16:06:25Z","number":410,"title":"08/9/23 Weekly Meeting 119 Notes/Agenda","body":"Weekly Meeting 119 is happening on Wednesday, August 9, 2023 from 9:00 AM PST (16:00 UTC) - 10:00 AM PST (17:00 UTC)\r\n\r\nYou can add it to your calendar [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/1?cid=Y18wZHB1Z2Y5ZjgzZXE0cWVrbWI2b21xYmptZ0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t).\r\n\r\nWe'll be meeting again in the omi-weekly-meeting channel of the [AngellXR/OMI Discord](https://discord.gg/NJtT9grz5E).\r\nWe regularly use the # omi-meeting-chat channel for text chat.\r\n\r\nWho we are and why we're here:\r\nThe Open Metaverse Interoperability Group (OMI) is focused on bridging virtual worlds by designing and promoting protocols for identity, social graphs, inventory, and more.
