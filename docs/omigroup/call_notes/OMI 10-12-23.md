## AI meeting summary
The transcript includes discussions about fixing issues in a project. There is mention of updating README, pushing commits, and the need for someone with expertise in Blender to create plugins. The conversation also touches on audio capabilities in Blender and making changes to the audio specification. Formatting fixes are mentioned, as well as potential improvements to the JSON structure. Overall, it seems that the team is working on resolving technical issues and improving various aspects of the project.

The participants are discussing the usage of emitters in a scene. They debate whether emitters should be singular or plural and where they should be placed (scene level or node level). There is agreement that emitters should be controlled with animation and that having a context of being the scene is useful. The conversation also touches on the difference between global and positional emitters, their properties, and their compatibility with stereo audio and HRTF. Some inconsistencies in the documentation are identified, but overall progress is made in clarifying the specifications for audio emitters in glTF.

In this part of the transcript, the discussion revolves around audio properties and behaviors in a 3D environment. The participants discuss different approaches to implementing audio, such as using zero-dimensional (zero D) audio or positional audio with limited range. They also talk about the challenges of using non-Ambisonic music files and how to ensure consistent playback. There is a mention of a hypothetical animation spec that could animate scene properties like audio but no clear consensus on its use case.

The conversation then shifts towards the concept of global audio tied to specific nodes or objects in a scene. The participants explore ideas such as colliding objects triggering audio sources and toggling scene-level audio based on collision areas. They note the need for an animation spec for glTF that can address these issues effectively. There is also a brief discussion about autoplay versus playing property for controlling when an audio source starts or stops playing. The participants recall past debates regarding these properties and suggest options like animating volume instead of relying solely on autoplay.

The transcript ends with some proposed changes to the KHR Audio specification, including adding support for seeking positions in tracks and considering animations paired with behavior definitions through an animation pointer extension.

Overall, this part of the transcript highlights discussions surrounding various aspects of implementing and controlling audio in 3D environments, including spatialization, playback control, node-object associations, collisions triggering actions, and potential improvements to existing specifications.

The transcript includes discussions about changes and formatting related to KHR lights, JSON formatting, Schema titles, merging of a project, voting for the merge using emojis, access permissions for certain individuals, and plans for future PR updates. The conversation concludes with farewell messages exchanged between participants.
