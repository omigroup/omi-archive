## AI meeting summary

A person suggests creating a template that can be copied and pasted for future use, with the intention of adding meeting recording notes later. They mention occasionally including screenshots as well. Another person asks if they are reviewing a PowerPoint presentation on 3D Web interoperability. The first person mentions that they recently discovered the 3D Web Consortium has been holding conferences for 25 years, but only had a virtual conference in response to COVID-19 in 2020 and 2021, which was conducted via video conference.

### Action items

Based on the provided transcript, there are no explicit follow-ups or action items mentioned. The conversation seems to revolve around discussing the process of creating and supplementing documents, mentioning screenshots, and briefly touching on the topic of a 3D Web Consortium conference. However, there is no specific mention of any tasks, assignments, or action items that need to be addressed or followed up on.
