## AI meeting summary
Keyframe and Jimmy are discussing the Mapping the Metaverse project. Keyframe is working on creating a 3D resource for mapping the metaverse and wants to curate all open metaverse platforms. The community is invited to contribute to data collection and research. They plan to build a prototype of a useful map for the industry, with the next few months focused on R&D.

Jimmy suggests creating an open database structure where anyone can extract data and create visualizations or stories. They discuss different approaches to organizing the data, emphasizing inclusivity and flexibility. Participation can happen through GitHub, with opportunities for researchers and contributors to engage with the project.

## Action items
From the transcript, there are several follow-ups and action items mentioned. Here is a list of them:

- Mapping the Metaverse: Keyframe is working on picking up the Mapping the Metaverse project into a 3D resource. They are collaborating with Stephen Van Loon on the data visualization.
- Curation of Open Metaverse Platforms: The community has been asked to support Keyframe in curating all the open metaverse platforms. This includes contributing data and conducting research to ensure that all active and available public communities are included.
- Prototype of a Map: Keyframe's focus for the next few months is to build a prototype of a map that is useful across the industry. This map aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the metaverse platforms.
- Data Warehouse or Raw Database: The idea is to create a data warehouse or raw database that serves as a gathering exercise. This would involve populating the database with information gathered from previous exercises and reviewing it to ensure its validity.
- AI-assisted Data Population: AI can be used to summarize and extract data fields from a list of sites. This would make the process of populating the database easier and more efficient.
- System for Contribution and Editing: The next phase after populating the database would be to create a system where people can contribute to editing the data. This includes allowing Metaverse owners, users, or anyone with additional data to input and review it.
- Feedback and Updates: Once the database is in place, it will be shared with the community for feedback and updates. The goal is to make it a useful resource that can be continuously updated and expanded upon.
- Categories and Fields: There are discussions on how to categorize and organize the data. The suggestion is to start with vital information such as the name of the Metaverse and then add additional categories as needed. The goal is to have an open database structure that allows for flexibility and inclusivity.
- Accessibility and Social Aspects: The current database or map does not yet reflect aspects such as accessibility, appropriateness for kids, and social aspects in terms of capacity sizes. These are areas that need to be considered and included in the future.
- Participation and Collaboration: Researchers and community members are encouraged to participate in the project. Ways to engage include commenting on the GitHub repository, contributing to the data cleaning process, and offering suggestions for improvement.

It is important to note that the transcript does not provide specific details on how to participate through GitHub or any other specific shout-outs for participation.

## Outline

I'm sorry, but I cannot create an outline with chapters from this transcript as it lacks clear divisions or headings that can be used to structure an outline. The transcript consists of a conversation where participants discuss various topics related to mapping the metaverse and creating a database of metaverse platforms. There are no distinct sections or timestamps that indicate clear chapter breaks.

## Notes
- Participants are discussing a project related to mapping the Metaverse and creating a prototype of a useful map across the industry.
- Keyframe is working with Stephen Van Loon on the data visualization aspect of the project.
- The community has been asked to help with the curation of open Metaverse platforms.
- The next few months will be focused on research and development.
- The goal is to create a database or data warehouse for the Metaverse that can be accessed and utilized by anyone.
- The database should include information about different Metaverse platforms, their statistics, standards, and interoperability.
- The database should also consider accessibility, appropriateness for kids, and social aspects.
- The approach is to start with basic information and then add more details over time.
- AI can be used to summarize and extract data from various sources to populate the database.
- The database should be open for contribution, allowing Metaverse owners, users, and others to add and review information.
- The main focus is to start building the database and then figure out how to keep it up to date effectively.
- Researchers and participants can contribute through commenting, editing, or using platforms like GitHub and Airtable.
- Keyframe will provide more information on how to participate through GitHub and give special shout outs for other ways to contribute.
