Some historical reasoning behind the decision to rename `OMI_audio_emitter` to `KHR_audio` can be found here: https://github.com/omigroup/gltf-extensions/pull/73\r\n\r\nTLDR reasoning it was renamed in the past: \r\n\r\n> The extension has been renamed from OMI_audio_emitter to KHR_audio. KHR_audio both reflects the intent for this to be an official Khronos ratified extension and a more general audio extension to form the basis for additional extensions to provide features such as audio mixing, animation/one shot triggering of clips, additional audio format support, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was general agreement that it should be KHR_audio_emitter\r\n\r\nKHR recommendation for naming extensions can be found here: https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/main/extensions#naming\r\n\r\nThe recommendation is to use KHR_scope_action so in our recommendation it makes sense that audio_emitter is the scope and action.\r\n\r\n> Names SHOULD be structured as <PREFIX>_<scope>_<feature>, where scope is an existing glTF concept (e.g. mesh, texture, image) and feature describes the functionality being added within that scope.
