but sometimes you want something like a bounce, or some other reaction noise, and singleshot spawns the sound object at the give position, plays it once, and then dies\r\nit's good for sounds that are going to play occasionally but not all the time - for sounds that happen frequently, like impact noises or weapon sound effects or whatever, it's often better to use an objectpool of sounds\r\n\r\n*whats starttime used for usually?*\r\n> I often use starttime for ambient loops - like that Blacktop Hoops world I built, it's based on a real streetball court in New York, and it has some ambient sound effect loops recorded from the real location, like 3-4 minutes long\r\nso I can use that same ambient loop with spatialized sound emitters positioned around the court, on the sidewalk and streets, but with different offsets\r\nso when you're moving around you get that sense of traffic and pedestrian and other random ambient noise coming from all around you, without having to use unique recordings for each location\r\n> it's not really segmented, it's playing the whole loop at each location - but because it's offset by some random amount, it feels more like infinite non-repeating loops\r\n> like you might hear a dog bark from your back left, and then a minute and 37 seconds later the same dog barks from your back right\r\n\r\n*maybe that can be used for bird chirps*\r\n\r\n> yeah exactly, that kind of thing\r\nif you have a couple different ambient clips of differnet lengths you can pretty efficiently do what feels like infinitely-unique sounds, because they're gonna loop at different times\r\nlots of tricks you can play to avoid the problem of super-repetitive sound....nothing drives me crazier than repeating ambient bird noises or whatever where it's a constant pattern 😄\r\n\r\n> in the context of gltf suggestions I'd say, singleshot is pretty engine-specific, that's more of a runtime thing, whereas the starttime offset would actually be useful to be able to specify in a gltf, if gltf is going to support positional sound emitters that can reference the same audio buffer\r\n\r\n```\r\njanus sound.* => KHR_audio.*\r\n     sound_id: .name\r\n   singleshot: **MISSING**\r\n   positional: .type==\"positional\"\r\n         loop: .loop\r\n    auto_play: .playing\r\n    play_once: .loop==false?\r\n         dist: .maxDistance\r\n        pitch: **MISSING**\r\n         gain: .gain\r\n    starttime: **MISSING**\r\ndistancemodel: .distanceModel\r\n      rolloff: .rolloffFactor\r\n         rect: **MISSING**\r\n```\r\n\r\nCouple record player implementations (janusweb / vrchat udon)\r\n- https://github.com/madjin/janus-custom-components/blob/master/media/recordplayer/recordplayer.js\r\n- https://github.com/Vard-and-Temmie/Udon-Record-player\r\n\r\nCouple new comments made to PRs\r\n- https://github.com/omigroup/gltf-extensions/pull/63#issuecomment-1158180272\r\n- https://github.com/omigroup/gltf-extensions/pull/88#issuecomment-1158176657\r\n\r\n"}]},"labels":{"nodes":[]}},{"id":"D_kwDOFwL-vM4APwzs","category":{"name":"General"},"upvoteCount":1,"updatedAt":"2022-06-09T22:38:39Z","createdAt":"2022-06-09T21:33:05Z","number":89,"title":"OMI glTF Working Group Meeting 6/09/2022","body":"# OMI glTF Working Group Meeting 6/09/2022\r\n\r\nThis meeting will be on 6/09/2022 at 10:30 PM (UTC) / 2:30 PM (PST) in the [OMI Discord](https://discord.gg/NJtT9grz5E) within the #omi-weekly-meeting channel.

However, they seem pretty supportive of it, which is great news!\r\n- OMI_ref\r\n  - We did some brainstorming on how references and overrides might work.\r\n  - Perhaps you can only reference properties of equal types. In other words, the object with the `OMI_ref` must have the same type of the object you are referencing. Ex. a node can reference another node, but it can't reference a scene or material.\r\n  - Overriding properties on the referenced object got a little more complicated:\r\n    - Overriding properties on the directly referenced object is pretty simple. You can merge the two objects together. So a node with a transform will override the transform of the node it references.\r\n    - Another way we could approach this is to allow exposing specific properties to be overridden. This would work for even deeply nested properties.\r\n- @antpb showed off using Spoke's media frames as references to objects which can be replaced other assets via scripting.\r\n  - Perhaps we could get the ability to define `node.extras` data in the Spoke properties panel. This would allow for a more direct way to reference objects via scripts and embed custom application data on a node.\r\n- @fire showed off their latest work on Godot's glTF import/export plugin API. You can now import some of the Mozilla Hubs components into Godot and there's now some APIs to define your own importer/exporter extensions. We're not far from being able to create interoperable assets with custom extensions in Godot!"}]},"labels":{"nodes":[]}},{"id":"D_kwDOFwL-vM4APlm5","category":{"name":"General"},"upvoteCount":1,"updatedAt":"2022-05-19T21:19:37Z","createdAt":"2022-05-19T21:10:15Z","number":84,"title":"OMI glTF Working Group Meeting 5/19/2022","body":"# OMI glTF Working Group Meeting 5/19/2022\r\n\r\nThis meeting will be on 5/19/2022 at 10:30 PM (UTC) / 2:30 PM (PST) in the [OMI Discord](https://discord.gg/NJtT9grz5E) within the #omi-weekly-meeting channel.

If you contribute hosting a meeting, that's not rewarded props\r\n\r\nRick: I don't think lurking in the voice chat is worthy of credits\r\n\r\nantpb: I think for this doc, we're contributing code.

We'd need a release or something, otherwise it's a grey area tht persists\r\n\r\nantp: I think we need to define it and none of this will get merged until that happens, another implementation is another thing we need.\r\n\r\nifire: table this?\r\n\r\nantpb: not time sensitive\r\n\r\nlyuma: Not even stage 1 yet\r\n\r\n\r\nMauve: Mauve reviewed omi-collider and a omi-physics body spec based on previous conversations from github and discord. Roughly based around Hubs and other game engines. You can add an extension to a node in a gltf scene called omi_collider. Schema is that it is an object with a type that defines what type of collider it is. In the case of hull, it is convex. Mesh is a full mesh. Each type has optional properties, like box can have a radius which sets w/h/d to defined value. Or you can specify an extents property which is an arraty that contains w/h/d.\r\n\r\nMauve: Todo do implementers need to set radius standards? \r\n\r\nifire: If no default should you set a value?\r\n\r\nMauve: use default in the spec if not set. For something \r\n\r\nAntpb: for things like radius, its hard to anticipate radius so maybe no default?\r\n\r\nMauve: todo, grammar and spelling\r\n\r\nifire: limit poly for hull to 255 similar to Unity. Avoids conflics.\r\n\r\nLyuma: we should find the lowest poly limit to set as the max for hull\r\n\r\nMauve: Callout a node can have a mesh assigned ot it and a mesh with a collider assigned to it\r\n\r\nMauve: Discourage folks from using Mesh without good reason. Maybe document better options.\r\n\r\nifire: regarding mesh limit, should be the normal mesh limit. follow gltf limits\r\n\r\n\r\nMauve: we should discuss the usage How can you have multiple meshes and colliders. Compound colliders are an option. Node could have one collider under a physics body. Or a node that has physics bodies that are colliders. \r\n\r\nifire: is an array of ids bad?\r\n\r\nMauve: you can have more than meshes as compound colliders. you can have multiple types merged together. Box, mesh, sphere example. One alternative is an array of colliders, but how do you position? Mulitple nodes means you can transform the nodes and the collider will inherit. Array of colliders should specify those trnasofmraitons. \r\n\r\nifire: so you can group based on parent? yes! :D \r\n\r\nMauve: capsule, how do you dtermine and change orientation. One option is to change the orientation in the collider object. Use trnsforms from scene graph.\r\n\r\nLyuma: unity is limit to what can vbe in the compound collider You need to use cardinal axis. Limit how things can be rotated. If you want compound, no rotate. can but aligned to the axis. \r\n\r\n\r\nRick W: Local axis. You can rotate via transform, bound to xyz.\r\n\r\nMauve: wording will need to account for this.\r\n\r\nMauve: will research\r\n\r\nMauve: we have a basic physics body spec as part of this spec. Marks nodes as a physics body. Single property type, static, dynamic, kinematic, trigger\r\n\r\nifire: static for me means it can never move. Kinematic is movable by script.\r\n\r\nLyuma: in godot static can be moving at constant velocity.\r\n\r\nRick: When I wanted to move a 3d object by collider, use the physics system that you have. Sometimes its okay to lean on the physics engine. You need to use scripts ot interface\r\n\r\n\r\nifire: dynamic means it can be moved, static cannot be impacted by physics engine but are in the world and can do things. \r\n\r\nifire: if we dont define kinematic it leaves it open for extension. \r\n\r\nifire: we need use cases first.\r\n\r\nMauve: wonder if there can be extensions for your extensions\r\n\r\nMauve: Table animation retargetting, prioritize next meeting"}]},"labels":{"nodes":[]}},{"id":"D_kwDOFwL-vM4AOgqx","category":{"name":"General"},"upvoteCount":1,"updatedAt":"2022-11-18T22:06:45Z","createdAt":"2022-01-16T18:37:29Z","number":51,"title":"glTF Working Group Meeting 1/20/2022","body":"# OMI glTF Working Group Meeting 1/20/2022\r\n\r\nThis meeting will be on 1/20/2022 at 10:30 PM (UTC) / 2:30 PM (PST) in the [OMI Discord](https://discord.gg/NJtT9grz5E) within the #omi-weekly-meeting channel.

The `-col` suffix represents a full Mesh colission node which is precise, but also expensive to run, the `-convcol` can be added to a mesh to hint that it's to be a [ConvexPolygonShape](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_convexpolygonshape.html#class-convexpolygonshape) which has performance improvements for convext polygons. The `-colonly` flag will remove the mesh itself and just leave the StaticBody colission object in its place.\r\n\r\nWhen using `-colonly` on \"empty objects\", you will be able to specify a primitive shape for collision  between \"arrow\", \"box\", \"plane\", and \"sphere\". (TODO: what are the parameters for each). These primitives are a lot more efficient for collision detection so developers should generally aim to use them instead of meshes whenever possible.\r\n\r\nWith the `-rigid` suffix, a node can be set as a `RigidBody` which can be configured to be `static` or `rigid/character/kinematic` (all of those basically mean non-static).\r\n\r\n### Mozilla Hubs\r\n\r\nHubs uses their own extension called [ammo-shape](https://github.com/MozillaReality/hubs-blender-exporter/blob/bb28096159e1049b6b80da00b1ae1534a6ca0855/default-config.json#L608) which define a type of collision shape for the object.\r\n\r\nThey specify a set of types ( `box`, `sphere`, `hull`, `mesh`) which can be attached to an object. \r\n\r\nThey also specify a way to automatically fit an object at runtime based on the objects vertecies.\r\n\r\nIt looks like this is applied to an entire object at once and there's no way to specify individual colission shapes within an object.\r\n\r\n## Potential paths\r\n\r\nI don't think we should adopt the suffx-based standard from Godot, but I think this gives a good idea of the sorts of things we'll want to consider for this proposal. I'm also not sure if the Hubs approach will scale well for complex objects that might have different bits and pieces.\r\n\r\n### Godot-style\r\n\r\nI think a good starting place would be the ability to specify that a node is supposed to be used for collision only by giving it the `omi-collision` extension which can specify whether it's a mesh (if it is, link to the mesh ID), or specify that it's a `primitive` in which case one can specify what type of primitive it is an the parameters for it (e.g. box, sphere).\r\n\r\nI think these nodes should not be displayed graphically and should only be used for collision. If you also want a graphical display, then you should be able to add that to the parent node. One thing to figure out is how a renderer which doesn't support these nodes will handle them, or how Blender could convert nodes in it's scene graph to be collision shapes for the GLTF.\r\n\r\nA node can have any number of these collision objects inside them. One question is whether we'll need to make any sort of distinction for the parent node along the lines of it being a RigidBody or not (or if it can be punted to a future physics discussion).\r\n\r\n### Hubs-style\r\n\r\nAlternately, it might be easier for developers if we go the hubs-style where the engine can compute the collision for a visible item at runtime with a higher level extension that looks like the Hubs one.\r\n\r\nThis would mean an object would get wrapped with it's collision, and I'm not sure how it could be expressed with the scene graph in something like Blender (could a child sphere node get marked somehow to be converted into a sphere collision shape for its parent?)\r\n\r\nIt seems this was mostly meant to be used at the top level of a \"scene\" object for an avatar so that it can collide with the environment rather than having several objects in a scene be collision-enabled.\r\n\r\n## Potential uses\r\n\r\nWith collision meshes in place, it could be easier for us to experiment with what physics or interaction could look like.\r\n\r\nI could imagine a case where you have a complex GLTF object which has buttons on it which can trigger \"collision\" events in a WASM script that will make it react.\r\n\r\nIt might also be a path to people starting to experiment with turning objects into RigidBodies (or the such) so that you can spawn a map with a basic collision mesh and keep players and objects from falling through it when you imbue the with physics.\r\n\r\n## TODO:\r\n\r\nIt'd be nice to get some feedback on which paths people think would be most useful to use as a group and if there are other paths we should consider.\r\n\r\nAnotherr thing that would be handy is if we could get more examples of importing and exporting collision meshes in editors and game engines to steer our focus.","author":{"login":"RangerMauve"},"comments":{"nodes":[{"id":"DC_kwDOFwL-vM4AHdvY","author":{"login":"AdamFrisby"},"body":"Pardon the dumb question, but does GLTF allow leaf nodes storing arbitrary data?

The concrete specifics of that (e.g. how meshes are decomposed, how to fall back for performance) seem better left to implementers and `SHOULD` in the spec.\r\n\r\nAfter V1 of the spec ships, it makes sense to explore things beyond just definitions of shapes.\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nAlmost all physics engines support the same high level set of colliders, the same concept of transforms, and the same basic parameters (like the bounds of a box, or the radius of a capsule), so a standard for \"this object has these colliders\" is easily implemented in any engine if you choose the correct set of objects.\r\n\r\nI could be wildly off, but I think this is a pretty complete set of everything you are likely to see:\r\n\r\n- Box (size)\r\n- Plane (normal, distance)\r\n- Capsule (radius, height)\r\n- Trimesh (triangles)\r\n- Convex/hull (triangles)\r\n\r\nDefining these, and the answers to questions like \"Which way is a capsule pill rotated?\" and \"Does a box start at the bottom or in the center\" would be a great start for interop across engines!\r\n\r\nThere are tangentially related physics properties that are common, like the friction and restitution materials for colliders, but I'm not sure if that has the kind of strong agreement across all engines like the above set.\r\n\r\nCollider types that are often supported and used but I'm not sure have enough de-facto agreement to be in a standard:\r\n\r\n- Heightfield (2d array)\r\n- Voxel field (3d array)\r\n\r\n## Extensions\r\n\r\nPhysics engines often have other tweakable properties on physics other than just shapes and positions. These seem like good ideas for future extensions.\r\n\r\n- Velocity animation\r\n- Skinning\r\n- Materials (slippery?)\r\n- Triggers (bonk head)\r\n- Gravity\r\n- Kinematics\r\n- Attachment (e.g. wearable)\r\n\r\n## Standard buy-in\r\n\r\nUnlike definitions of colliders, there are significant and legitimate engine/gameplay disagreements about user interactions, mechanics, optimization, and performance of physics. That makes it a difficult proposition to have any opinions about that in the standard.\r\n\r\nGames+engines will always optimize for their own users and usage regardless of what the standard will say. However the baseline definition seems like it would be pure 👌 for everyone, since it is easily implemented and does not dictate the rest of how your game should function.\r\n\r\n## Next steps\r\n\r\nDream starting point for me would be a very simple GLTF metadata standard for a set of colliders similar to the above list, with the intention to prototype and see if there is anything else that is universally needed in such a standard.\r\n\r\nWebaverse would gladly contribute mapping code for THREE.js GLTF -> PhysX WASM."}]},"labels":{"nodes":[]}},{"id":"D_kwDOFwL-vM4AOdoQ","category":{"name":"General"},"upvoteCount":1,"updatedAt":"2023-02-22T00:28:48Z","createdAt":"2022-01-10T18:22:38Z","number":49,"title":"glTF Working Group Meeting 1/13/2022","body":"# OMI glTF Working Group Meeting 1/13/2022\r\n\r\nThis meeting will be on 1/13/2022 at 10:30 PM (UTC) / 2:30 PM (PST) in the [OMI Discord](https://discord.gg/NJtT9grz5E) within the #omi-weekly-meeting channel.

We can add contributers later if they aren't already in there.\r\n\r\n## Collider extension\r\n\r\n- Mauve: Went over discussion https://github.com/omigroup/gltf-extensions/discussions/50\r\n- VRM springbone colliders? Should we consider them? https://vrm.dev/en/docs/vrm1/changed/#vrmc_springbone\r\n- Should look at virtualcast https://github.com/virtual-cast/VCI/tree/master/Assets/VCI/UniVCI/Scripts/Format/GltfExtensions/NodeExtensions/glTF_VCAST_vci_colliders\r\n- Robert: Could link to accessor within the extension to something like  a trimesh while leaving it invisibile in default viewers.\r\n- IFire: Wanted to degrade to regular GLTF,\r\n- Robert: It should use the accessor so that it won't be visible\r\n- Mauve: I think meshes can be refereced by their index in the array\r\n- Robert: Might not need to even be a real mesh, but just the trimesh that's an array of vertecies. Wrote a trimesh extension for hubs for the terrain.\r\n- IFire: Do we want to force it to only be convex shapes?\r\n- Lyuma: Can we have convex trimeshes? Just don't want rigid bodies with concave\r\n- IFire: One could always turn concave into convex\r\n- Mauve: What's the reason not to support it?\r\n- IFire: Wanted to know if we want it to present well on the engine side\r\n- Lyuma: Worried about performance, could make really bad perf if you use concave meshes incorrectly. If you ahve lots of polys if they're in a small volume (like the face), would have lots of intersect tests and freeze the game. One _can_ so people probably shouldn't use it\r\n- IFire: The idea is it should be ready to use for runtime use.\r\n- Mauve: I think it'd be useful for folks to at least have the option.\r\n- IFire: TBH, I'd have it auto-converted to hull\r\n- Lyuma: But you probably shouldn't convert it. E.g. a house might be better as a trimesh\r\n- Koolala: Do many static boxes end up getting merged into one large static trimesh for collisions? Or is keeping around all the boxes actually better?\r\n- Lyuma: Keeping boxes is better. 50k box colliders run fine even on iOS, very efficient.\r\n- Mauve: Would you be okay with concave for edge cases?\r\n- IFire: VRM only supports capsules for collision\r\n- Lyuma: They support both with a bool\r\n- IFire: Do we want to ban them anyway?\r\n- Robert/Mauve/Lyuma: Not really, we want concave\r\n- humbletim:Where do these collisions come from? Blender?\r\n- IFire: You generate the shapes as part of a workflow.\r\n- humbeltime: Then re-generate on changes?\r\n- Mauve: Usually folks create empties in Blender and name them to be colliders for the Godot export\r\n- humbeltime: How do the colliders get rendered?\r\n- IFire: They usually get drawn in visibly\r\n- Robert: Hubs actually supports having multiple ammo shapes.  (link in dicsussion)\r\n- IFire: Found a convex decomposition thing\r\n- Robert: Kevin from hubs did a lot of work on this.\r\n- humbletim: Collision models from blender: https://www.katsbits.com/tutorials/blender/collision-models.php\r\n- Robert: Auto-generating shapes works pretty well, but does break in a lot of instances, would want to manually define trimeshes as well. Would be good to have a default and the ability to override\r\n- humbletim: In Hifi, we used fbx or obj for collisison model URLs. It was a pain in the butt, adding trimesh support was easier for creators. Led to performance bottlenecks\r\n- Robert: Found a thing for splitting concave into convex. Seems like somethign that should be done upfront instead of on the fly. Might want to tweak it. Somtimes you'll put an entire environemnt, then auto-generate colliders and get messy colliders. Had this happen in hubs and it wasn't optimized.\r\n- humbletim: To back up, what's the purpose of colliders?\r\n- IFire: body, props, hair\r\n- Lyuma: Static and dynamic bodies. Level/terrain. Rigid bodies is something you pick up.\r\n- Rick: Might want to tie other aspecs to the data\r\n- Lyuma: Should reccomend using different mesh data from rendering\r\n- Mauve: I think it should be useful for collision like entering an area or pressing a button\r\n- Lyuma: Trigger colliders? Some environments require those to be primitives\r\n- Rick: Also blocking seeing through.\r\n- Lyuma: Occlusion culling?\r\n- Rick: You want something to be dropped in an enemy could not see through for ray casting. e.g. you can move through but it won't block the line of sight.\r\n- IFire: Imagine a tree is a quad, and you're behind it. That kind of thing.\r\n- Lyuma: Interacing with the behavior\r\n- Lyuma: Probably way out of scope via stuff like layers and masks, quite relevant to these questions. e.g. visibility detection\r\n- Rick: Good example, I'm working on a mech warrior game, like you can walk over some debris as a mech, can't as a pilot. Works with physics collision matrix\r\n- Mauve: Could we table the physics and masking stuff as being something after we get colliders together?\r\n- Lyuma: There's overlap in these concepts. There are some engines that will forbid you to use a trimesh for a rigid body. Regarding layers, usually there's a small number of layers.\r\n- Should define mroe use cases and scoping\r\n- Robert: Just having the collider and gemetry could be good to start with. Just knowing that would be good and then we can work on additional extensions like friction, dynamic rigid bodies, static bodies. Maybe we're just specifying the collision?\r\n- Lyuma: Concern for OMI. If people implement these specs.  WHat if they have something like a teacup that they'd want to pick it up. It could be useful as defining if something is static or not. So adding ones that don't block movement.\r\n- IFire: want to preserve the use case of something being immovable while it's on the ground.\r\n- Mauve: Might be useful to figure out after with physics\r\n- Lyuma: Can we even get it to stage 4 if we don't have stuff visible?\r\n- Mauve: Good point maybe we need to have physics discussion as part of colliders?\r\n- Lyuma: Immediate payoff is level geometry\r\n- Robert: Or objects with colliders you can grab. e.g hubs generate one for something like a duck, but others not at all.\r\n- Mauve: Should we have something like static/dynamic/rigid in the parent?\r\n- Lyuma: Yeah, maybe extend that with future types that default to \"no collision\"\r\n- Mauve: Maybe have additional extensions on top of no-collision?\r\n- Lyuma: e.g. ai-trigger is no-collision with another extension\r\n- Robert: I wonder if we can do that at the application level. E.g. where it's brought it can determine if it's static or dynamic. Like a prop is probably dynamic. If it's environment probably mostly static. Maybe a small piece will be dynamic, but can we define the behaviors in the spec?\r\n- antpb: Can we offer additional fields?\r\n- Lyuma: That could be an extension. Dynamic things like probably shouldn't be allowed to use static. A map _could_ have dynamic stuff. Also trigger areas. The application side is where I define what happens, but would want to include the area in the area. Also kinematic?\r\n- humbletim: Kinematic can be moving, but it's not part of the physics sim. Some engines have this disctinction\r\n- IFire: Like not physically simulated, but animated\r\n- Rick: Also talking about WASM. A holy grail could be an avatar with a GLTF with a WASM component, so behaviors associated with it.\r\n- Mauve: That's a big use case I had in mind. E.g. having tigger boxes, then the GLTF listen for the trigger and set an animation or react in some other way. We can give people a lot of power for very little extra code.\r\n\r\n## Demo from Avaer and Jin\r\n\r\n- Jin: We've got stuff like animation retargeting. Will screen share something like changing an avatar and metaverse files and how they work. Showed picking up a potion with an avatar for e.g.\r\n- Avaer: In terms of metaverse files, it's like a GLTF extension, but we're putting it in a separate .metaverse file that gets put beside the GLTF and explains what the file does. We put it on top of the actual files we use. Part of a potions behavior is that it can be picked up, and we specify which bone you can attach to. For example when you're wearing it it's attached to your left hand (on a VRM).\r\n- IFire: Is passing it to another person possible?\r\n- Avaer: Every object has an \"owner\" and that's either a person or the world. So if you pick it up it gets owned by your character rather than the world and can be brought with you. Referencing the potion as a URL within the scene files.\r\n- IFire: So moving from the world to you is parenting, can be tricky?\r\n- Avaer: This is all ThreeJS based, so you're reparenting from the world to your avatar. Colliders are automatically generated using autotrimesh. I found in engines if you have gameplay you want, it's a matter of cusomtizing physics. WHich objects have them and which don't.And which kinds of colliders. Found most engines support the same sorts of primitives. So if you support those things, it's easy to write a plugin in any engine and get it in. After you need to do optimization of constants, but that probably shouldn't be in standards and isntead in games. But in the first place having physics properties for an object is important.\r\n- IFire: Talked before about wanting something to be \"movable\" and this is required for this use case.\r\n- humbletim: How did you get the positions in the metaverse file?\r\n- Avaer: In the future we're hoping for tools in game\r\n- humbletim: Is there a standard scheme?\r\n- Avaer: one meter\r\n- humbletim: Can you scale them?\r\n- Avaer: You can scale them right now\r\n- humbletim: One thing I saw is puffing out collision hulls, adding a bit of a buffer so it isn't going to go into the wall\r\n- Avaer: THat's something in a physics engine, not something that should go into the engine.\r\n- humbletim: Scale matters, and if we aren't assuming a cosmic scale, the same object might indicate different qualities in different worlds\r\n- Koolala: If you can scale avatars, and avatars are the scenes, then being a 2x scale avatar might make stuff you pick up become 2x\r\n- Lyuma: Fits into issues with trimeshes, they break down when you scale them. The way it's implemented is you check every tick which polygons intersect. If you have a lot of items in a room it'd be a project.\r\n- Avaer: Most engines have a quantization process during the baking process. This model is very high quality, but the generated mesh is very efficient.\r\n- Lyuma: If you're allowed to change this at runtime there's no problem, if you know the scale it shou--- (I lost track)\r\n- Avaer: The potions for example ahve a different scale when you grab it\r\n- Jin: Regarding animation, they don't come with the GLTF\r\n- Avaer: Two schools of thought, manually animating each character, or retargetting one to many. We retarget at load time for a VRM rig. Where this plays into standards is the objects also have \"use\" properties which talk about which animations it works with. e.g. \"drink\". Each character knows how to drink.\r\n- IFire: Curious about how you attach and how you attach to a skeleton for animation.\r\n- Avaer: There's a regular Three skeleton and we attach (the potion) to the skeleton directly.\r\n- Avaer: We have a case like wearing helmets where we warp to your character. If you don't get the morphs right, the helmet will poke through the hair. Much harder problem.\r\n- IFire: Even attaching to the skin correctly needs to be the exact bone.\r\n- Avaer: Hoping for tooling to do it automatically\r\n- Evo: Is this working in a networked situation?\r\n- Avaer: Everything under the hood uses CRDT deltas to compute the positions, changing replicated data and the single player world alsso reacts to it. Was using Y.js. Didn't support binary, rewrote to Y.js\r\n- Evo: Same process for attaching to an avatar?\r\n- Avaer: Correct that's why when a player enters they bring all their objects with them\r\n- Robert: You mentioned the mxmo animation is done at load time. Is there a way to store that in the GLTF file that's already normalized to the skeleton?\r\n- Robert: Proposing storing the animation in a separate GLTF file that are already ready to go for regargetting against a VRM skeleton\r\n- Avaer: Two files?\r\n- Robert: Two, yes\r\n- IFIre: E.g. animation1, animation2\r\n- Avaer: Seems like an abuse of GLTF\r\n- Robert: GLTF is built as a container that's for any of it's sub nodes. Been hacking on just materials in a GLTF. The spec leaves it up to the engine in order to figure out how to load these resources from a GLTF.\r\n- Jin: Reminds me of how previous gens used mpeg, VRML for avatars. Is GLTF our version of it?\r\n- Nova: GLTF is a lot more like an SVG.\r\n- Robert: If we can normalize for a single format, we can get rid of the bloat for needing e.g. FBX. Can package up stuff like animations, or potions could contain animations for drinking itself\r\n- Jin: Reminds me of a cool collection of armor, all the GLTF files are attached to GLTF armatures in VRM files. E.g. props could be attached to armatures for exporting, can export with the JSON.\r\n- Avaer: I wonder if it makes sense to have a set of standard animations, or whether everything should be in the object. I could see it getting heavy. E.g. 100 potions with their own animations. Or should drinking be a thing\r\n- IFire; Hard to agree on what those are, everyone could make their own. At least some people will want extra animation sets just because\r\n- Nova: For XR, a full body tracking extension would let you do this. Is it a bad thing if you have a bunch of use animations? THey're pretty cheap all things considered\r\n- IFire: Cheap compared to images and audio and videos\r\n- IFire: Do we want to specify a list of animation sets?\r\n- Robert: Being able to reference them from separate files would also be useful. So if 30 files reference one, we can do that.\r\n- Lyuma: Unclear, why would the potion be responsible\r\n- Avaer: Currently isn't specifies it's drinkable. How would one reference the GLTF?\r\n- Lyuma: If a character wants a custom one they can. There should be a platform default\r\n- IFire: There's three things: Animation sets on the char or object, object having specific tag for the game platform\r\n- Rick: Specifying \"Drinkable\" or \"does damange\" would be useful.\r\n- Avaer: Would it be the chars or the objs?\r\n- Lyuma: I don't think objects should. There have been cases. \"Stations\". Characters can play animations specified by the object you're itneracting with. e.g a dance station.\r\n- Jin: Seen in MMD worlds\r\n- Lyuma: Could see both sides. \"Does damage\" sounds like a tag. Application specific data. Protocols are an interesting concept for metaverse applications. Two content creators agreeing to a protocol without the platofrm agreeing. Person A says they're using a tag for a damange system, person B could implement it too.\r\n- Nova: In minecraft they eventually had a standard \"FE\".\r\n- Robert: What can we do to wrap up the animation retargetting?\r\n- Avaer: What's the procedure for starting the standard.\r\n- IFire: Gotta join W3C, then pull request\r\n- antpb: COuld go in a discussion to talk about it before the PRs.\r\n- Robert: starting with a discussion, then making a markdown doc\r\n- IFire: Is there a specific one you want?\r\n- Avaer: Getting the colliders definitions.\r\n\r\n## Wrap up:\r\n\r\nRobert: Thanks for coming in. Will see you next week. If you're coming to the WASM meeting, it's 1 hour earlier than last week."}]},"labels":{"nodes":[]}},{"id":"D_kwDOFwL-vM4AOb7D","category":{"name":"General"},"upvoteCount":1,"updatedAt":"2022-07-01T11:09:49Z","createdAt":"2022-01-06T21:27:57Z","number":47,"title":"glTF Working Group Meeting 2022-1-6","body":"### Agenda\r\n\r\n- Discuss Explainer doc: https://github.com/omigroup/gltf-extensions/pull/46\r\n- Godot Doc\r\n- Blender Addon Updates\r\n- Collider extension\r\n- Animation retargeting for VRM workflow\r\n","author":{"login":"antpb"},"comments":{"nodes":[{"id":"DC_kwDOFwL-vM4AHVJA","author":{"login":"fire"},"body":"Work for gltf2 buffers and extensions is now merged in Godot Engine as of https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/393a44b275152c660b2010598661b2730c9c60a8\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32321/148462349-dac8569a-685a-48bd-8a27-b68545765066.png)\r\n\r\n![editor_screenshot_2022-01-06T144044](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32321/148462446-e39a601a-eef8-41ca-9383-8dcaaf02720b.png)\r\n\r\nExisting and pending work for glTF2 extensions https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues/3305:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvirtual Dictionary get_import_settings() { return import_settings; }\r\nvirtual Dictionary get_export_settings() { return export_settings; }\r\nvirtual void set_import_settings(Dictionary p_settings) { import_settings = p_settings; }\r\nvirtual void set_export_settings(Dictionary p_settings) { export_settings = p_settings; }\r\nvirtual Error import_preflight(Ref<GLTFDocument> p_document, Dictionary p_export_settings) { return OK; }\r\nvirtual Error import_post(Ref<GLTFDocument> p_document, Node *p_node, Dictionary p_export_settings) { return OK; }\r\nvirtual Error export_preflight(Ref<GLTFDocument> p_document, Node *p_node, Dictionary p_import_settings) { return OK; }\r\nvirtual Error export_post(Ref<GLTFDocument> p_document, Dictionary p_import_settings) { return OK; }\r\n// Error import_animation(gltf2_animation, Ref<Animation>, Node *,Dictionary p_export_settings) { return OK; }\r\n// Error import_animation_channel(gltf2_animation_channel, channels, Node *, bake_bone, bake_channel, bake_range_start, import_bake_range_end, action_name,Dictionary p_export_settings) {}\r\n// Error import_animation_channel_target(gltf2_animation_channel_target, channels, Node *, bake_bone, bake_channel,Dictionary p_export_settings) {}\r\n// Error import_animation_sampler(gltf2_sampler, Node *, channels, bake_bone, bake_channel, bake_range_start, bake_range_end, action_name,Dictionary p_export_settings) {}\r\n// Error import_asset(gltf2_asset, p_export_settings) {}\r\n// Error import_camera(gltf2_camera, Camera3D *, p_export_settings) {}\r\n// Error import_gltf(gltf2_plan, p_export_settings) {}\r\n// Error import_image(gltf2_image, p_export_settings) {}\r\n// Error import_joint(gltf2_node, Skeleton3D *, BoneId, p_export_settings) {}\r\n// Error import_material(gltf2_material, Ref<Material>, p_export_settings) {}\r\n// Error import_material_pbr_metallic_roughness(gltf2_material, Ref<BaseMaterial3D>, orm_texture, p_export_settings) {}\r\n// Error import_material_unlit(gltf2_material, Ref<Material>, p_export_settings) {}\r\n// Error import_mesh(gltf2_mesh,Ref<ArrayMesh>, vertex_groups, modifiers, skip_filter, material_names, p_export_settings) {}\r\n// Error import_sampler(self, gltf2_sampler, Ref<Material>, p_export_settings) {}\r\n// Error import_node(gltf2_node, Node *, p_export_settings) {}\r\n// Error import_scene(gltf2_scene, Node *, p_export_settings) {}\r\n// Error import_skin(gltf2_skin,  Ref<Skin>, p_export_settings) {}\r\n// Error import_texture(gltf2_texture, p_export_settings) {}\r\n// Error import_texture_info(gltf2_texture_info, p_export_settings) {}\r\n// Error import_merge_animation_extensions(gltf2_animation_source, get_gltf2_animation_destination, p_export_settings)\r\n```"},{"id":"DC_kwDOFwL-vM4AHVJo","author":{"login":"antpb"},"body":"Note: Field trip to Third Room soon!"},{"id":"DC_kwDOFwL-vM4AHVKE","author":{"login":"antpb"},"body":"3DWebWorldz.com to help in validation of audio emitter extension. thank you! @antpb to assist in implementation"},{"id":"DC_kwDOFwL-vM4AHVK9","author":{"login":"RangerMauve"},"body":"https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/workflow/assets/importing_scenes.html#import-hints"},{"id":"DC_kwDOFwL-vM4AHVLi","author":{"login":"RangerMauve"},"body":"I'm gonna lead putting together a proposal for the collission discussion.

They are all at various states in terms of what features they support. This may depend on the end goal of the plugin for each of the plugin's authors. I think this should be taken into consideration during the evaluation, but first I think we should objectively examine the features they have currently.\r\n\r\nWe need to define what criteria we will use for an objective evaluation. We should keep in mind the target audience for our plugins during this process. #3 \r\n\r\nTo start off, but welcome to suggestions:\r\n\r\n## Extension support\r\n- [ ] Native extension support\r\n\r\nAs our target is new GLTF extensions, one of the main questions to ask. Does the plugin have an out-of-the-box method to add any arbitrary processor of GLTF extensions? We may also want to consider the feasibility of adding this functionality to the plugin if it does not exist.
