## Section 1: Overall Summary and Key Points

The Open Metaverse Interoperability (OMI) group held a meeting to discuss their progress and future plans. The group acknowledged that there has been less hype around the metaverse recently, but they remain committed to promoting interoperability and open standards. They discussed the importance of showcasing the benefits of open metaverse interoperability through content creation and collaboration with other organizations.

The group also touched on the challenges of managing finances for their organization and explored potential partnerships with other groups, such as the Linux Foundation Europe.
