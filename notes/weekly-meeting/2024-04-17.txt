# Open Metaverse Interoperability Group Meeting Summary

The Open Metaverse Interoperability (OMI) group met to discuss various topics related to their work. Here are the key points from the meeting:

- The group discussed the progress made on OMI Physics Gravity, which allows users to specify custom gravity directions and shapes inside of their GLTF scenes. They also talked about the possibility of creating a demo for it.
- Jimmy shared his idea for a simple lightning talk sign-up form to collect information about people who would like to be interviewed or share their knowledge with the group. The form includes fields for email, web link, area of knowledge, and suggestions for other participants.
