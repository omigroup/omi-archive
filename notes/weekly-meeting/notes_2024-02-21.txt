## Summary
The OMI group meeting focused on discussing a demo and a new website mock-up. The demo was created by Mr. Metaverse but needed some fixing before being shown to the group. It was suggested that they have a general catch-up while TommyCost sets up his demo. The new website mock-up, created by MTV, was also discussed, with the group agreeing that it should be voted on as a communal feedback step rather than a blocker.
