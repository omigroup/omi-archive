# Summary
The OMI group meeting focused on updating the Open Metaverse Interoperability (OMI) audio specification and addressing inconsistencies in the documentation. The team discussed the use of Blender for audio implementation, bundling audio with GLTF exports, and the need for a global emitter property on nodes. They also touched upon the differences between 2D and 3D audio, as well as the potential addition of an animation specification to support audio behavior animations. The meeting concluded with action items for Aaron to create a Blender plugin using sound strips and update the OMI audio PR in the glTF repo.

# Action Items
1. Create a Blender plugin using sound strips to bundle arbitrary sound files with GLTF exports.
2. Update the OMI audio PR in the glTF repo.
