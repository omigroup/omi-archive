**Section 1: Overall Summary**
- Discussion about adding a UID extension to GLTF files to preserve node identities during import and export processes in game engines.
- Concerns raised about the need for industry-wide adoption of such an extension, as well as potential conflicts with existing standards like KHR XMP JSON-LD.
- Discussion on the benefits of having a UID system in place, including improved workflow efficiency and better data preservation between applications.
- Concerns about the complexity of implementing such an extension across different game engines and DCC tools.
- Suggestion to create an OMI extension with the Godot namespace as a starting point, which could later be renamed to Chronos.
- Discussion on the need for more diverse voices in the group to ensure a well-rounded standard is developed.

**Section 2: Action Items**
1. Continue discussing the UID extension proposal and its potential benefits and drawbacks.
2. Explore the possibility of creating an OMI extension with the Godot namespace as a starting point, which could later be renamed to Chronos.
3. Reach out to industry experts in audio design for input on developing a PBR-style system for audio materials.
4. Encourage more diverse voices and perspectives within the group to ensure a well-rounded standard is developed.
5. Investigate the feasibility of inter-extension dependencies in Kronos for future extensions.
6. Consider the possibility of procedurally generating audio properties based on material definitions in game engines.
7. Explore potential collaborations with Pixar or other industry leaders to develop a standardized approach to audio materials and interactions.
8. Continue discussing the UID extension proposal and its potential benefits and drawbacks.
