# Summary
The OMI group discussed various topics related to KHR Animation Pointer and its potential use cases in audio, scientific applications, storytelling, camera control, FOV changing, historical recreations, and customized previews. They also touched upon the possibility of connecting physics to animation and the integration of GLTF with interactivity graphs. The group discussed the idea of creating a vehicle extension that allows for more flexibility in terms of vehicle design and control schemes.

# Action Items
