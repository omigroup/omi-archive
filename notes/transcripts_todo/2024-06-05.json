Totally possible, just not quite prepared for that much streaming. Yep, that's completely fine, and thank you, Jimmy, for all the work. I'm sure we'll use it in the near future. I think we're all doing a lot of stuff, and it's great. Maybe just not the right time right now. Okay, so I am recording. Cool. Do you want to present now or wait a bit? Yeah, I will share my screen and go through a presentation about a pipeline for taking notes. And from meeting calls to videos that we've done in the past, how we can auto summarize them, how we can turn those into something that can be consumed in a more digestible, faster way than where we're storing a lot of notes currently, how we can share them different ways. Let me just quickly get something set up here. One second. All right. Is my screen showing? Yep. You can see it. Okay, so this presentation, I don't have slides. I do have this world, which I could go through. And I'll just start off with this video right over here. So in this video, this is meant to illustrate how currently... okay, so like this is how our notes are stored right now. Like you see GitHub discussions, there's like kind of these speed bumps where you're only viewing one meeting at a time, and when you export all the notes into like for example PDF form, you could just quickly go through all the past meeting notes much faster. And that's the overall theme here. How can we reduce friction and just increase the bandwidth pipeline for all of our past notes and also just go from something that's more timeline and linear based to something more topographical, interstitial. Because the metaverse, when it comes to all these different disciplines and all these different subjects, we need a more kind of bigger canvas for all these ideas. And so I kind of do see HyperFi as like an infinite canvas tool. You can drag and drop and edit stuff in here. And that's like, we'll get more into that in a bit. But so right over here, you know, I've got a couple of screens. And as you can see, they've already updated with recent notes. You know, you see 6, 5've already updated with recent notes. You see 6-5-24, 5-29. This is the last four weeks of meeting notes. And this is auto-updating. This is not something that I... I didn't change this world. I haven't been in here in a while. But how it's doing that is it's fetching the poster from a URL that is auto-updating from a GitHub action process that I recently fixed up. And that GitHub action is basically taking a JSON snapshot, but also screenshots of the last, I can set it for however many weeks, but for the last four weeks, between different repos, and uploading it to a static website. So then you can just grab those permalinks from here and use it as a texture that dynamically updates every week. It just runs the scripts as a cron job and will refresh this poster. I do want to get it to be more intricate with the ways that you can express images and replies and kind of go from something that is so very linear to something that is following the trees of thought and discussions and where the conversation goes. This is inspired by Gray Crawford's work, who is kind of like a prototype engineer. Doing a lot with this. And what I've been doing as well with MSF is I've been taking all these meeting notes. notes. I'll go over here. I downloaded around 80 gigs of data from all the Zoom calls, and there's an open source repo, which is called VTT Summarizer. We're using Ollama, all local vtt-summarizer and we're using olama all local open source models to do summarization. For this one it's phi3 and we're using the instruct model which is really good for kind of more objective type stuff. The other ones are more chatty. But this pipeline is basically about exporting JSON and Markdown notes from the transcripts of our meetings. So I've got some examples, and I'll apt-ar. Okay, so I'll just show here. Is it dealing with audio files as the raw input? Correct. Okay, nice. Yes, it's all the audio files. So Zoom gives us that automatically. that automatically. And their VTT, which it's just kind of similar to SRT, subtitle transcript type of file. I can show you what it looks like. But the overall pipeline, tweaking this prompt so that we kind of get, right now it's giving an overview of each meeting, some notes and a timeline of things. And just kind of doing some tweaks on the pipeline to get some notes. But all of this was generated in like 30 minutes. So we can do transcription as well, but Zoom already does that, as well as who is talking. But the notes are pretty overall good. So I take the markdown, and I'm using a combination of Pandoc as well as some HTML capture packages, capture website, QTcapped, puppeteer, choose your flavor. There's a whole bunch out there. But I basically inject a little bit of CSS with the Pandoc command line. And I get a nice markdown HTML. And then I screenshot it for every single meeting with the date of the meeting as well. And the file name structure keeps everything kind of nice and organized such that I'm able to easily import it into Blender as images. So in Blender, I think it's not enabled by default anymore. But if you go into Preferences and go into Add-ons, you can enable Import Images as Planes. And working on a script right now that can do all of this, as well as creating the art frames. This is just done through a series of extrusion and inset type commands to create a frame automatically from images. And I will say also, before I import it, I add a 10-pixel border around the images so that when I do extrude it, I get the black framing around it automatically. And then I inset it. So now this is like a chronological timeline from all the different meetings, as well as the notes kind of associated with each meeting as a 3d object. And I'm able to, you know, like, take all those and export it, you know, another Blender Python script. So then we have 3d files of the meeting notes. And where I want to take this next is creating an asset palette. Well, before I get into that, I wanted to also mention, let me see. Where is it? Box, not here. It's not here. Good, huh? Yes, here. I do have another script that goes through the videos. And this is still a work in progress but it's a combination of ffmpeg and some python scripts to kind of detect differences and then crossfade the screenshots from a presentation together so this video is generated automatically. I manually took these screenshots for my first iteration, but I'm working on making this more automated. The overall vision is like, kind of like getting a hyperlapse sort of speed run, a quick rundown of like what was discussed at the last meeting. And I think the AI pipeline can feed into this. Like I have something that kind of detects how long each meeting is, and then a prompt about like kind of creating a overview summarization, like a sentence or two about what was discussed. And maybe we can combine it to kind of create hyperlapse quick rundown videos about each meeting. But yeah, the script basically takes a whole bunch of images and crossfades them together. So that's another way of making notes and meetings more digestible in a more visual way. But I'm not sure where the files are right now. And here's the video links, by the way. So this is going sure where the files are right now. And here's the video links, by the way. So this is going to feed into another prompt about getting a video summarization about each meeting within that length of time, such that we can generate either subtitles or text-to-speech to combine with the videos. But what I was going to show is GLTF export. I think it's here. Yes, posters. So I have this other script that basically takes a whole bunch of images and is creating, based on various aspect ratios, an array or a grid of images like this. I'm working on making it. As you can see, it's still a work in progress. I want to make it power of twos and nice image resolutions for optimization's sake. But this can be an atlas that can be UV mapped to different types of objects, not just like these frames. Maybe we come up with more dynamic various objects. And kind of going back to what I would love for this tool to look like with those sorts of visuals. Right now, this is the most basic representation. We don't have to stick with it. Maybe we break out these different frames into other types of things. There's some slash models. Something that an M3 member worked on for dynamic objects, which is this spinner artifact here. And this is just one example of kind of thinking outside the box. All of these images that you see in this artifact, it is sort of like an atlas. Why does it look like that? All right. Yeah, so it kind of looks like an atlas. But yeah, as you can see, we don't have to just stick with these frames. Anyway, going back to this. So we also can export these posters and that is something as well, you know, like we can go from the Blender pipeline, automatically export it into a virtual world or, you know, export these individual assets and create a HTML kind of drag and drop palette. I'll just kind of do it locally to show you. So we have our meeting notes with us. And I want to create a website which backs a turn system more into an inventory system. And the goal I'm trying to solve is reducing friction for all of our notes, digesting what a working group is working on. Not just like in between MSF, but, you know, metaverse standards forum is a perfect sort of case for this because, you know, they're aiming to provide this forum for all these different other organizations and groups that are aiming to coordinate and work on interoperable open standards but our activities notes and you know what we're working on our discussions accessing that you know currently is um sometimes a lot of hops and hoops to go through. Like if you're wanting to access another working group within MSF, their notes, I counted about seven different links you have to go through after logging into the portal. And I just want to reduce that where you can automatically take all the Zoom recordings, summarize them, export, markdown, that can make its way into a knowledge base automatically using a static site generator, MKDocs, or DocuSource, whatever. Also create videos. Also create these atlases and objects that can chronologically align these things. Maybe we can align it based on months. Maybe like the Blender scene is organized based on each month and a year so you can kind of see what each group is working on. Maybe the Y axis. So one group takes up this point in Y and another group takes up another point. And so the inspiration was SIGGRAPH with their white paper gallery, where they kind of have these rows of white papers that you can go through. It's kind of like an art gallery, but for these white papers of different computer graphics techniques. I saw it once, and I'm like, oh, you know, like Kronos, MSF, all these people have been to SIGGRAPH. MSF started at SIGGRAPH with birds of a feather. It was like a side event there. So we can auto-generate this type of stuff for different working groups, and go through it and literally kind of walk through our ideas um and also all that uh summarization can make its way into llm training so that you know there can also be like these uh booths that an ai agent can help you kind of talk through some of the ideas about what was discussed what it's about what you know and also has all this other context about what the working group is working on and so it's like a everlasting metaverse conference in a way that we can create and create a virtual forum for all of our notes, so that it's not just stored somewhere in either a portal or a forum or GitHub discussions, but something that we can bring into virtual worlds as these assets. And this creates also a reason for us to build and establish more presence in these virtual worlds where we can connect with users that we're trying to benefit with through our work, you know, working on intravable standards and file formats by creating this kind of proof of work and what our activities are and whatnot, then these users of these platforms can better understand us and also maybe give us some feedback and inputs and it also creates an opportunity for working groups to dog food more by building a presence in the East Metaverse by creating assets that are relevant to what we're doing. That's part of the inspo and I have a TL draw that is kind of like a overview. And this is what I presented at the Open Canvas working group yesterday. They had a meeting in TL draw. So this is their notes. And I just love how they're dogfooding it. They're talking about interoperability between infinite canvas apps and are using infinite canvas apps to do so, to take their notes. And this is what we should be doing. You know, like early Internet users, they were using the Internet to collaborate with one another. And, you know, these other working groups are using Infinite Canvas apps to do the same, and so we should find ways that we can collaborate with one another using the metaverse, and I'm trying to build the building blocks for that, not necessarily the final piece where they all fit together, more of a proof of concept of that, but just the interoperable assets that we can use to dog food stuff more. use to dog food stuff more. So the thing that I presented that kind of also covers MSF use cases, going from recordings, this can also be Meseeks as well in here. I'll just quickly take a screenshot and add it in. And add it in. And the idea is go from whatever meeting data source into transcript files, which Zoom provides. And if you don't have the transcripts, you could use Insanely Fast Whisper. And then I'm also grabbing stuff from GitHub. So I've got a script that fetches screenshots of the GitHub discussions, as well as JSON outputs. We can go from this. This is all markdown. So we can also go from this JSON to some markdown to HTML. But what I'm really interested in and what I presented here is, can we go from this GitHub discussions JSON to JSON Canvas spec? So that we also have interop with 2D Infinite Canvas apps. So if we can kind of simplify and turn it into this JSON Canvas spec, which by the way, they also have a Z, not just X and Y, they also have a z, not just x and y. They added z as well. So I found that to be interesting. But then we can maybe go from JSON canvas to 3D force graphs. Maybe we can figure out a round trip between canvas and markdown canvas to Blender. That would be interesting. So it's not just kind of arranging things on a chronological order, but kind of based on the layout coordinates that you have in the 2D canvas. So it's kind of like we're designing a Blender scene from the top down. And then we can export those three file formats into war rooms, knowledge spaces, writer's room type stuff, and have it and be immersed in our notes and build a presence in these different platforms, which are kind of like an infinite canvas app in themselves, you know, like Hyper-Fi, Hubs, RIP, and others. And that's kind of one of the end games there. But that's the overall pipeline being worked on. And here's kind of a more simplified illustration, like data and a whole bunch of different outputs, and then just creating different representations of our meeting notes so it's not just you know chucked onto github and never read again you know i'm trying to find ways to recycle all that information and so this is the recycling machine That's super cool, Jen. I was just wondering, does this project exist on GitHub by any chance? Parts of it. So we have, like, I'll just drop some links. This one is the OMI archive notes where I've got the GitHub actions running every week. So at midnight every Thursday, it updates the posters. And it also contains some notes about the AI summarization pipeline. And this one contains assets and examples for applying it with MSF. So as you can see, it is still a work in progress. I'm kind of like deploying and prototyping these techniques within these different groups. Thank you. That's all really great. I can hardly wait to see it all working together, and I hope I can contribute. Thank you. Yep. Any other questions? for even longer, like some of the HackMD posts that you've had up there, kind of lean into this direction of sort of how you, you know, again, produce like a network operation center for your personal information and how you can achieve that sort of as an outcome here you know and the navigation function is really where it seems like you're in the accumulation phase as much as doing a bit of navigation that uh spinning uh spinning implementation, the thing from, yeah, this thing. That's a little bit moving towards navigation where you have a selection possibility. I don't know if you could change what was on there to fit, you know, and have that as, you know, it's almost a click through to that piece of information, to that piece of information summarizing itself, you know, from 150 plain cards that you have out of a thousand plain cards that fit that particular filter that you may have selected through that spinning deal. They can force you some, I can see this moving a lot in a direction that I'm very interested in myself. And I'm working on a similar project, but in a very different line of light that I hope to be able to do a presentation on one day, too. But I think navigation is one of the big things that you're moving towards here, obviously. And you've been thinking about it like that. The great Crawford stuff is some of the best out there. So good point of reference. Excellent presentation, man. Yeah, I hope I can present it with some of these techniques in the future. Gray's work has been really inspiring. And a lot of it, you know, it's like these mid-journey prompts. And we see Glimpse's, he's trying to prototype with some different spatial prototypes. He was a leap motion Motion interaction engineer, so he's got a lot of skills there. But I just think this would be so cool. I totally see this being possible to build out of a GitHub discussion or anything that follows these reply chains and whatnot. You could very much create something like this with some Blender. I think even just the pipeline where you're screenshotting web pages to create these things would be interesting. It just changes things where instead of looking through a split scan or one slide at a time of a presentation, viewing everything at the same time, not just per presentation, but per all presentations, it hits different. And you start to see some of the more connections between different ideas more easily. And AI's ability to manage those connections, you know, you have all of these directed acyclic graph tree sort of approaches towards summarization exactly that where those where those arrows actually reflect relationships you could say this is uh under contract to or has contributed to or is produced by and all of those arrows become something that's searchable and surfacable through AI as a organizing tool just to create you know the the difference between that and just a keyword search because now you're doing semantic searches now you're doing things that are the the level of understanding connectedness and meaning is equally consumable in a spatial environment. So it's something that's actually easier to look at those relationships when you're dealing in 3D. And that's what, you know, I still feel like you're at the accumulation phase more than you are. And once you've got everything in a in a big you know data pool sort of environment i can see that being a very interesting uh road of progress i think i'm near the end of accumulation like i've got over a year now of omi recordings i've got all the msf recordings uh and a whole bunch more that it's in a private repo at the moment. I've got all of Kent Vi's Voices of VR. I've got all the Building the Open Metaverse podcasts as well, all M3 recordings. So, you know, I've accumulated tons at the moment and always will be. I love doing that and I think it's kind of an evergreen type of task. But now I'm at the point where it's like, what can we cook with this data? And one thing that AI is really good with is in one of these outputs, as you can see, I combined all the meeting notes into one markdown file. Well, this is really good to just chuck into Cloud. down file well this is really good to just like chuck into claude and i did that with a digital digital fashion group and the avatar characters group i provided it all of our meeting notes summarizations and i started to ask some questions about um like our activities objectives deliverables challenges and as well as some questions related to the, like a SWOT chart in terms of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats. And it gave me some really interesting responses and found some cool alignment patterns between them. And so it's just like, I'm already seeing a lot of value in that, you know, like if, you know, if you look at all the different working groups and you can see, like, there's not that many people who attend more than one group at MSF, you know, one or two is tops. So it can act as a way to find opportunities and alignment and kind of be a glue agent between not just internally, but also externally with the members and the other organizations working in these relevant domains, which can aid in outreach efforts, which can aid in marketing, promotion, all that. Amazing. That's fantastic right yeah and and that process i think achieving it there's a way to do that spatially to uh navigation i mean that's i yeah you got all the right pieces. And you're doing it, man. Perfect. Yeah, I'm going to share this section right here where I'll put this in the OMI general where, yeah, this was kind of a meta-analysis between the two groups. Just to kind of give an idea of how awesome this is. All right, it's in OMI General, so you can kind of see Interoperable Avatars and Characters, Digital Fashion Group, and here, this section, the opportunities. There are several opportunities to collaborate more closely and solve problems together. You know, we could align our efforts for translation framework, shared guidelines for critical components like attachment points and systems. points and systems. We borrowed a lot of ideas from the avatar group for use case matrices, collaborate on test assets, validation tools, common optimization targets, techniques, etc. So, yeah, it was a lot of stuff that was discussed between these two groups, so I just find it really good for meta-analysis type of tasks. Once you kind of like, you know, all these meeting notes that are chucked into the MSF portal, it just kind of reminds me of a whole bunch of delicious fruits just waiting to be squeezed into a smoothie of sorts. A blender, per se. It is fruity. Any other questions? Or if anyone else had anything to share or updates, don't want to take up all the time. Appreciate everyone tuning in. And if anyone wants to follow up on working on this, check out the GitHub links. And, you know, like one thing I'm really interested in is how we can take this data that we're generating and create different outputs. I don't have an automated script for bringing it into Blender and turning it 3D yet. I'm going to start simple, kind of like what you see here with chronological timeline representation. But I think it would be interesting to try different stuff, especially interoperability with canvas formats. I think that could be really cool to see. Maybe a booth format instead of just a plane. This is how it is in Model Viewer. Maybe make it a little bit more sophisticated. Thanks, Jen. Just from Keyframe, he shared an update about the virtual museum mapping status. So this is the GitHub page that they developed listing all the worlds that they have been creating hubs in and it's also just a very nice list of all the currently available worlds. So Keyframe asked, he can't make it today, asked me to share it with you and if you're interested please get in touch with him. Does anyone have updates? We did a test run on Spaces yesterday. Jimmy, do you want to give feedback on that? Yeah, so we did a Spaces. It was MTV, Indy and myself just uh popped in set it up left going for about half an hour the conversation was similar to what we would have had in here just uh with i think maybe three people popped in and popped out at over that time period um but we got the fundamentals of it working meaning you know i i that was the first time i've started a meeting on myself i've been co-host before but we were able to get in co-host mode and see how that you know menu system works and things so part of it was just kicking the tires but i think we will uh in the future like for instance, Jen, if you were going to do one of these at some future date when you're comfortable doing one of these presentations, we would use that as kind of our, we'd go into a Twitter space, for instance, and have a few of us, the more people we have in there, the more people will join because it's only visible to people who are connected to people who are in that room already. And so we might try and do one of these, you know, in advance of another show and tell, another thing that we want to try and drum up some people other than, you know, the regular community to see who's interested in joining. So watch that space. Sounds good. Thanks, Jimmy. Yeah, I think it was a good effort and certainly improved confidence that it's a good additional outreach avenue. Erin, any updates on GLTF? Let's see. What did we discuss last week? I'm not sure, actually. I'm not sure actually. So on that, I want to draft a blog post about what the GravitySpec is and the progress so far. And I thought that this was going to be a pretty simple thing to do because I just, I know that you did your demo on the 17th of April and then I went into that file and neither the audio nor the transcript seems to want to take me further than 20 minutes in. And so I was wondering if someone can help and see if they've got the same issue. It's the meeting on the 17th of April. And then I also just want to ask Aaron if that's cool with you. I won't publish it yet. I'll draft up something and then send it back to you and the team to read. And then I also just want to ask Aaron if that's cool with you. I won't publish it yet. I'll draft up something and then send it back to you and the team to read and see how it goes. Are you happy with that? Sure. Sure. you know, how OMI was formed and the W3C thing. And W3C is very much a technical consensus builder. I don't think we're using it to its full potential. So I wondered, I don't, maybe not this week, but, well, you know, does anyone have thoughts about how to work, make that work better? Because it does sound like it's specifically a technical thing to explore. Do we know when W3C has meetings? Is there already someone acting as a liaison? Mr. Metaverse and myself are listed as chairs, but it sounds like it's a research group and I don't know anything about what other groups there are and who we can liaise with, but our group is sort of an independent little thing which isn't meeting with anyone else. So I'm not sure what the setup is there. So the discussion with Humble Tim was in the context of the GLTF group, how can we get more support and more sort of acknowledgement to the GLTF group? And W3C was raised as a means to do that. a means to do that. Yeah, I think they're definitely one of the, you know, co-similar groups to ourselves, along with MSF, for instance, and specifically within W3C, because it's a huge organization, obviously, is the immersive web workgroup. And those are the guys that are handling the Webbex r standard for instance maybe there's a few other you know parts of that community that might be specifically worth talking to and concentrating on um but the immersive web group and they have kind of you know they have a mailing list they have have open parts of their contribution group. And I don't even know if maybe this is actually already somewhat connected to that work group as part of just the community groups that are connected to W3C. Cool, thanks, Willis. are connected to W3C. Cool. Thanks for that. I added the two links in the chat. But I think the question is, from a technical perspective, do we need to reach out more? Or is it a case of organic collaboration like what's happening with MSF? case of organic collaboration like what's happening with msf they have something called a meet and greet that they do every few months maybe once a quarter something like that in addition to their regular committee uh meetings and the activities on the github which is their main organizing system, from what I can tell. It might, you know, if one of us happens to be, you know, I don't know, everybody's around the world, if anybody was able to join one of those meetings in person, it would be a nice thing. And maybe get a little bit involved from a liaison point of view. Let me look into that a little bit because I've been following that group. Probably some of the other people in here have too. Maybe there's ways we can at least you know, I don't know from a liaison point of view or attend things that are similar activities because they definitely have, I mean, they have direct relationships with the Kronos group and everybody else who's in GLTF, for instance. Yeah, I was going to mention too, in terms of technical conversations, it probably makes even more sense to focus directly on the Kronos Group, since they're the official owners of GLTF. Yeah, so the thing is there that our OMI GLTF group sometimes has frustrations with what is being done in, for example, the Kronos group. And as an indie community, we seem to not have enough clout to get our ideas heard. And so the conversation was about how do we link up with other organizations to give the OMI group a little bit more presence so that our ideas are considered with equal weight? Sure. I think it's totally cool to kind of approach it from that community perspective, from that open source perspective. And, you know, maybe it's just more the kind of community outreach, like getting into more places in front of developers. Because I think that that's like a really good value proposition for a lot of people. It's like, hey, you know, you don't want to have to work with the Kronos group and try to get these things ratified as standards. That's a huge long process. But OMI provides this community-based approach for building GLTF extensions. In addition to kind of having the official channels with Kronos that maybe eventually get their way into the standard, but kind of having that home for people that want to kind of move faster and lighter. Yeah, thanks. Gary says you have to be a selected representative of a company to go to a meeting in MSF, which is correct. And so there is that sort of corporate vibe. Just a reminder again that OMI does have a general, or does have a membership, I think, I'm pretty sure. And so we can attend meetings under that umbrella. But yeah, it's a difficult thing to do. And then just on that, I have been, I'm in continual conversation with the Linux Foundation. And the latest that I heard back from Naomi was that the Linux Foundation formation team is discussing the ideas for partnership. To note carefully, Omi will stay independent, but the partnership is more around joint support for projects that's under Omi's umbrella. We don't know what that will look like. She said she'll keep me posted on next steps and they'll probably want to meet with myself and other members of OMI. So that's the slow progress step, progress nonetheless. Right, that was all that I wanted to share and get input on. Someone please help me with a transcript of the meeting of 17th of April. It's on the hour. Anyone want to give some general feedback or thoughts from the last week. Right, well thank you everyone and thank you again, Jin, for that awesome demo and I'll be jumping into the lounge for a little bit if anyone wants to chat more casually. And see you all next week. And I think GLTF meeting is tomorrow evening. Well, evening my time. And good going everyone. It feels like things are starting to happen. It feels like the hard work is slowly starting to show presence. But this is the long game. Alright, have a good week everyone ciao thanks y'all see you later see ya"}
