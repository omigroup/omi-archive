Tomato Bush, you want to run the meeting this week? Yeah, sure. Well, hey, everybody. Welcome to another week of our OMI gathering. Something I was working on, I was sharing my screen earlier. I was just kind of you know inspired and i feel like our weekly meeting is very much like gathering around a water cooler but way cooler um you know i think we're all we're all free of of the confines of an office space we work on our own things but we do do meet kind of around our own water cooler or I guess in a natural sense, more like a watering hole. We do a lot of things here at OMI, right? Like we try to champion and evangelize open source and open standards. We try to show folks, I mean, different members of our community, write documentation, create videos, and really just get the word out there about what metaverse interoperability really should be and could be, thanks to the work of so many folks like yourselves. So I really like our Wednesday meetings. I think it's kind of like us all meeting around the watering hole, I would say, from a more natural sense. And so I was working on some little tweet that I'll post out later, just kind of saying, join one of our Wednesday meetings. And something I was making earlier was was based on that so um thanks to come in for coming to another weekly gathering around our watering hole so oh my um we i guess have a few things on the agenda you you shared them before we hit record and what was the first thing we wanted to start with today so i think the biggest thing is that we had a gltf um chat with the chronos guys last week and actually well two days in a row last week and i wanted to know you know who attended it and what was your feelings what was the takeaways both in terms of the actual content that was discussed and the bigger picture you know i think it went really well i'd love to do it again so and what was your feelings, what was the takeaways, both in terms of the actual content that was discussed and the bigger picture? I think it went really well. I'd love to do it again. So I'd like to hear from others how to do it better or what was your feelings about it? I think the discussion was fantastic. The only possible concern I have is what actions will be resulting from that discussion. Because the Chronos members that were there mentioned that they in particular don't have influence. They have to talk to other people to discuss things. But overall, it went really well, I think. The concerns that we raised were acknowledged and recognized and agreed as valid things to be concerned about. Yeah, so I think overall, you know, it was good to feel heard. But yeah, there's this latent frustration of, so now what? And I feel like that's like a broader issue about, you know, how do grassroots people and independents contribute? Like, it's just, it's hard, and it's something that frustrates me. And, you know, that's obviously something that's core to UOMI as a group of Indies. I'm trying to make it work. Yeah, I think it starts with us adopting, right? Like, there's even members that will join these calls that don't necessarily adopt all of our protocols or open protocols. There's some platforms that still haven't implemented BRM, for example, right? So, like, just to friendly Ryan, like, there are things that we do control that we can lead by example when we're feeling defeated in the broader kind of ecosystem and our level of ability to make an impact. I think we can. There are things that we can't control and can do something about. You want to get with them again? I think maybe... Oh oh go ahead yeah the uh you know i'm not saying maybe shift the whole gltf weekly conversation to something like twitter spaces but maybe at least make that a regular thing because it leans into the working in public and opens it to a slightly wider audience you know I know Jin did a lot of the coordination with making sure the actual GLTF guys themselves were in attendance but if we made that a regular thing you know again sort of on a casual sort of basis, but in an open format, I think then that's sort of the purpose of what we're doing is opening this to community and letting a lot of voices into the standard process. But I thought it went very well. If that ends up being like an actually helpful thing i'd totally be up for that uh i i do wonder like we did have much higher attendance on twitter than on discord but i am imagining that's mostly because of the uh discussion and involvement with like chronos like advertising it as like hey both chronos and OMI will be here. If it's just a Twitter space that is OMI hosted without any Kronos advertisement, I wonder if the information we get would be similar to Discord. As someone that helped organize it i would say definitely a good point there with what aaron just said and um it just kind of requires reaching out here for speakers and um you know if uh we want to i would say it's you it's best used sparingly because we all kind of experience the kind of weird quirks and glitches that Spaces has. And that it's good for outreach, but it's not a replacement by any means. Like the screen sharing features, I don't even think it's working that well. Like streaming to a space is still very experimental. Screen sharing is really useful. So it's good for outreach when we can find ways to kind of align with other groups and speakers that can kind of broaden our audience. But other than that, we should find other, yeah, we should keep experimenting, though, just with outreach strategies. I'm glad we did a space. Yeah, thank you, Jen, for organizing that. So one of the things that one of the guys said was if users can blog about it more, and I was thinking that's maybe something we can help even though it's a it's a balance to strike about what is too detailed and what is too high level but if we can get users to just share their experiences and that could be on discord and we can just send we can market it better you know say on twitter what's happening and send emails out on the W3C mailing list. But the actual platform, I think, is less of an issue. Well, it's cool to hear that we're taking this multi-channel approach. I don't think it can hurt. What's next, Connor? Unless anyone has any other comments about this? I wanted to say it felt really good working with the team. It felt like it was something that everybody pulled together and just did. And I didn't think it took that much effort to do. And so it was kind of fun. I enjoyed the whole experience. Thanks. Yeah, that's thanks in large part to the folks in this community that maintain strong relationships over there. So I'm sure others were involved too, but shout out, Jim, for being such a great bridge and advocate. So the one thing before we move on is that I do want to get a blog out today that is quite high level. So basically just saying that this thing happened. I don't know if I should share my space. And I don't know if people have opinions on what should be in there. So Jin did a lot of writing, which just ended up being, I think, way too much for a blog post. But then you did, Jin shared the bullet point somewhere, and I keep losing that link. And so what I thought to do is literally just saying that we had concerns. Wait, Indy, can you just, like, zoom out your screen for a second? Like, control minus for a couple taps. For a second. Like, control minus for a couple taps. Okay, now you see that table of contents on the left side? Yes. Now you can just quick hop to that space if you get lost. Yes, I get that. Yeah, just in case. But yeah, you're right uh i threw everything in there which is is great um and so i was just wondering so for the the blog post i want to link to this i don't want this to be the blog it's too much um like i don't want it to get lost by trying summarizing it um but i don't want to blog the whole thing. So I just need a link for this. And so I was wondering if there's specific takeaways that anyone wants to add from an overall sentiment, or do you just want me to wing it and go? You can click on the green top right button where it says share, snag a link, and then just link to it in the blog, which I think is your intent. And then if you want other folks' feedback, just drop it in chat if it's not already there. Let me see. Yeah. Cool thing about HackMD, I think everyone has probably seen it before, but it's collaborative. And he said every day, all day. Wow. Look did that? That's Pablo, our newest member............ So do people want a few minutes to read it? Do you have any strong feelings that should be included in the blog? Anything that needs to be done better in future? Then I think we can... Let's put, because sounds can get uncomfortable, right? Let's just put like a timer, a timer of five minutes, like just Google five-minute timer and give folks actual time time especially because you said you want to get this posted today and so that we can actually get that feedback in there so anybody opposed to that you can listen to your own music or we can i can sing to you you can play your video okay yeah i'll play my video. My video is kind of disturbing in the end because it's meant to be like an homage to like 80s slasher movies. It's not like violent. I had to trick the AI into making some of the images in the end, but with that very small warning, I'll share my screen like anyone else in this community I just sometimes just really want to make something and starts with a simple process and then I just iterate. I only spent maybe four hours on this, including Blender, in the end to compile it all the way. I don't know if it's going to be too loud. Can you hear it? Thank you. is oh That's my short movie. I had to use ketchup to make the shoe scene. The last one looked like wrapping paper, but it's just disturbing. It wasn't like a body, but it fit the image that put it in there. I had some other images that definitely looked like more violent from like a real slasher movie. Um, to do that, I asked for mannequins or to use mannequins. Um, but in the end I opted not to include it because I didn't want to cross that line. It was meant to be like a fun video, fun slasher homage. So thanks for letting me share. The song and all that stuff, every part of it was AI. Pretty cool. What was the workflow? So for that workflow, I used a little bit of Midjourney. I'll share my screen. But for my mid journey, I've been really enjoying they have this web based tool. It's alpha that mid journey. So if you've made enough images, you get access. Basically, the reason why I like this better is because when you are in a creation, like pipeline, you can really quickly just hit up to get your previous prompts. So you can make really quick changes. You get four ages at a time like you do in Discord, but it seems to be faster. And you're just able to get a bit more work done. So I can quickly, and you can run multiple creations at the same time so like let's say i know i like this one so i'll say i want to vary this one subtle so we'll get those going and let's say i like this one very strong so i just get two pipelines going at once until i get on something that i like so here's how i got to it you'll see um you know there's some really good images here but like it's too scary in the story that i wasn't trying to tell like that another story was kind of meant to be like a love story of like you know jason and and and and jason's partner so um these are the mannequins it's really violent so i'll skip through that it's not people obviously but um the outcome was what I was looking for experimentally, but in the end it was not fitting. I was able to work really quickly through this pipeline. And one of my favorite things to do is to look for prompts that have been shared. It's like prompt share or inspiration. So if I use a prompt that has prompt shared, in this case, I didn't, I usually reference it in the alt tags of the work when i share it um but if you are looking to like quickly find some things that are uh fun and experimental just search for hashtag prop share and you'll get really quick inspiration beautiful art styles most of the time they work um so you can take this i love this format i mean this is kind of how i think and i would love this type of ux for the metaverse right like avatar uh and then you know the home like world like uh that kind of like jim jim's done um so that you can bring your own your own assets in this case And that's very much the ethos of how prompt sharing is, right? Like they're saying, insert whatever artist you want here, give that artist a bit of a description here. So it's like thinking in code in many ways. And so it's fun. So I usually do something like this to get inspired and then go into mid journey from there. I didn't just use mid journey. I was actually playing around in Colab. This is what started the whole rabbit hole that day. I was learning stuff with Colab, and then I was like, all right, I want something that I really know, and I wanted to apply it. So I used Colab to kickstart. I basically made a stable – I was using stable diffusion 3.5, and I was just trying to learn how to run it through CoLab. This is pretty basic stuff for some folks, but I'm always trying to, like, enhance my actual development skills. So rather than just talking about it and selling it all dead. So that's where this started. Then, so I have some images that were made here in stable diffusion. Then I used Midjourney Alpha because it was a faster workflow, and then I pulled them into Runway. So there's a lot of apps that are coming out that make it easy to animate videos. I've just been using Runway for a long time. So you can usually just select what asset you want, go ahead and upload it, give it a prompt if you want, and then just hit generate. You get four second clips. You can extend the clips. I like this workflow. I would love to learn how to do something, run something locally. That's kind of next on my journey. Actually, I don't know if you guys have ever heard of like generative UI. This is actually what I'm working on right now. But the concept of generative UI is super cool. We can talk about that next. So on my list is to learn how to start doing video rendering locally. But in the meantime, I use Runway. And after that, I pulled it all into Blender. I like Blender for video editing. My reason is that I never really took time to learn any other video editing tool. And I use Blender all the time. So this is how I do my drag everything in and got it sorted until I thought it's a good enough story. And then the last thing I did is I went to Suna. And, wait, is it Suna? Let me use it. I think it's Suna, right? Suna. Okay, whoops. So I tried out Suna for the, I guess it was the second time, but first time for this video. With Suna, I mean, I think they're under a lawsuit right now. So careful using them. It also looks like maybe they've been hacked. I can't tell. That's going to Alibaba. Or maybe I clicked on a app. I don't know. Okay, so this is what Suno is supposed to look like. And so you're able to generate AI music from a problem. So in this case, I just said chill, simple, and soundscape. I liked it. it gives you two options here's the one that you heard and uh it gave me this one too which was also really good gives you all the lyrics if you wanted to words on screen by and large i mean i'm not saying this is as good as the music that i listen to I love music and I love supporting musicians. But for getting some, you know, music that I could use for an art installation and that fit and that, you know, I was able to just use, I thought that this was really great for the workflow. We'll see how the lawsuit shakes out. So that was it. That was my workflow. I'd love to do something like this. This is what I call the glue. I wrote an article about it recently on Substack. Basically, we want AI to do everything for us. I'm being dramatic here. I'm sure a lot of people here definitely don't. But folks spend so much time trying to get perfect prompts and trying to get everything done in one shot and instead of just realizing that like any acceleration to your I don't know what I'm doing I'm trying to if you change if you consider yourself like the glue you can use i walk through the process here in this article um you yourself can be the zapier right like take the gains that you're getting and use your brain for the rest. And I think that's pretty great that we've achieved that in this lifetime, even if we don't achieve anything else beyond that. So. Pablo says, I like the post and now I am curious and would like to know about the integration with OGG Audio. Oh, OMI Audio? OGG, so I don't know if it's original, maybe? OGG is an open source audio library like MP3, but it's just open source. And it's very widely used on audio on video games. And I'm pushing a little bit to have a better audio on the experience that we have now, because I think it's broadly missing. And yeah, there you go. OGG. Oh, let me share the link. For audio in GLTF, we have an extension to the KHR audio emitter that allows you to use OGG audio. That's awesome because the audio designers that I know, they all use OGG for video games because they can loop the audios and they can do a bunch of things that with MP3 is not possible and the compression is much better. And yeah, so cool. Also worth mentioning, if your goal is best compression, there is a better format out there called Opus. It is, however, not quite as broadly supported. OK, yeah, that's maybe why. Yeah, if you can share it, I take notes and ask my friend who is the one who is taking care of the audio. The audio extensions, you can find it just in the Omni glTF extensions repository. In the extension slash 2.0 folder right there, there's all the extensions, and there's two that start with OMI Audio. Mr. Metaverse has posted a link in the chat. Wow, there it is. Thank you. That was satisfying. Okay, this one. I love the random magic that comes out like you say something and then it just leads to all these other stuff. That's how we learn. Yeah. Yeah, we have an agent build right now for a customer and they are a DJ. And I think I may have told you guys about it, but we're a little bit further along on it. And basically, they at any point in time want to be able to just text this agent a song. It goes on to their DJ pool memberships that they're subscribed to as a primary source, and then backup source would be something like YouTube to MP3, but let's focus on the primary. Basically, it downloads the song, and then it runs it through stem separation on the back end using Python, and we've been trying different tools for that. And then it puts the stems, so like the vocals in one bucket, and then the drums in another, and guitar and other audio sources in another, so that when they get home, it puts it in their S3 storage. So then whenever they get home, or if they have access to Wi-Fi, they can download it to their decks and start mixing. So it's pretty, pretty cool. I've been exploring a lot of these types of tools. All right. Any other comments on that? Observations? There's a blog post draft in the chat attempting to combine... Oh there's a... Okay, there's a blog post draft. Awesome. About the... TLT of Interactive TV. Do you want folks to make direct edits or comments? I think probably direct edits, right? So we could publish that. My concern with that is that it's so generic. I don't know if that's what people want. It's not something I would want to read. But, you know, whatever. Anything we can build more around this? Because this kind of gets to my point again. It's like, this definitely gets us 80% of the way there. Now we can just add our own unique flavor to it. That's kind of like the future of work. I hate to say it, but everybody I know in the commercial and government space is using AI in some way to summarize or get started on their response. And then they're using their brain for the rest. So it's like, here we go. We've got a really great foundation. I think this is good. But it's not a great foundation. So to be a bit spiky, there was a thread in Debian about AI and this one guy said it's the McKinseyfication of words. And like, I don't know how to better describe it. It's fluff. It annoys me. Yeah. But I mean, if that's what you guys want to publish, they can republish it. It's fluff. It annoys me. Yeah. But I mean, if that's what you guys want to publish, then we publish it. I'm just, ugh. I'm sorry. Let's make it, like, how might we get to what your mental model is? So the thing is, if you want to publish something quality, and so there's links to like this bigger philosophical thing about I suppose intellectuals you know like that take forever aiming to produce something of high quality so it's like analysis paralysis so if you want to get something out quickly then this is good if you just want content, great and you know if that's what you want to put on the only blog great i'm not gonna stop you this is not something i'd ever put on my blog like i would rather have very few posts and those posts be good quality so what's our next step to achieve quality because i totally support that i think everyone agrees like is it do we start from scratch and or is there some way we can iterate on this one i'm just curious how we can help a lot of the posts on um the blog on the hackmd that jen shared has a lot of quality and then it becomes too much to read so it's sort of like meeting minutes that you know you can link to and if someone wants to read it then they can go read it but it's it's a a lot of text whereas what is a blog post supposed to do it's supposed to be a hook and say hey this thing happened um and so what what i had after talking to jimmy in the media meeting yesterday was literally chronos released this um gltf we had some concerns and so we reached out to and I wanted to list the people to obtain clarification and then we had three takeaways and it was really the things that I remembered was the emphasis of keeping keeping the specs simple. There was an overall approach of the system that I listened I was in the meetings and I listened to the audio again but then I'm not technically enough, so I lose things. My eyes close over. But there were three components. It was at the 18-minute mark on Friday that was very powerful. And then I think the meta takeaway from a community perspective was that taking in ideas from different members, especially more indie developers, should be improved, and there needs to be more engagement in publicly accessible ways and so that's what that's literally all we tried to do with the spaces event so we were very pleased at the engagement and hope to have more in the future and then I just thought the last sentence of the blog could be a call to action so there's a discord specifically for the chrono CLTF and they've got a bunch of links that Jen also shared how to get involved. And so that's sort of where I was. Yeah, so I agree with Jen in the chat to just publish the bullet points from both dates and the links in the NYTGLTF. And so that to me is separate to the blog post. It's a more technical conversation. And so what I've been trying to ask is where do we publish that? Is that also a blog on OMI, or is that a GitHub spec link? Interesting. I think, for what? For which one? I think the one you're talking about is a blog on OMI. I think we can link directly to the HackMG as a referenceable doc for more details. the one you're talking about is the blog on OMI. I think we can link directly to the HackMD as like a referenceable doc for quote-unquote more details for meeting those. Yeah so Jen said the link blog post in the GitHubithub you publish the bullet points on oh my I agree with that I think a hack MD can disappear we don't have control over that whereas the blog we have you know it's on our server and does anyone else have comments on this because yes it's a specific issue for this blog post but it also talks about how we go further you know this is like the the trial run for future, for how we do things. But I'm happy to publish two blog posts then. So one that's got all those bullet points and then another one that's just short. Or both in the same blog post but just with a separator. Yeah. in the same blog post but just with a separator. What's the target audience that is this blog for? Yeah, so exactly. So I think the bullet points are for people who would be interested in participating in the GLTF spec. So that is like a super technical crowd. And the blog post that I'm looking at it from a community perspective. So anyone who's, you know, indie sort of struggling against the big corporates should be able to read that and go, hey, you know, this is the place for me because people can help me. So that's why I would rather have it as two separate blogs because I think they target slightly different audiences albeit with a big overlap. That sounds good. I'm not a technical, even though that I work with them a lot. So I might be biased. But I did understand that is something that I want to investigate and find more about it and yeah probably for someone new it could be a little bit scary yeah exactly so I want a post that really has the meat. Like I think so many good things were discussed. But for someone like you, Pablo, and myself, we'll get scared away. But we're good as people who can fetch other people and work with more technical people. And so being welcoming to people like us, I think, gets more people in. And more people in means eventually down the line more people contributing to specs, you know, through friends and friends of friends. So I feel strongly about having them as two separate posts. They could both be Omiblogs or the one could be on GitHub. I feel like the technical information there is good for GitHub. a ghetto What do you mean with feed the beast, Jin? Yeah, so content that comes in all shapes and sizes and colors. So while Pablo is speaking, I want to show... So this is Numinia. This is the link that they shared in our thread last week sometime. And I think we should have a experience about this maybe one weekend. So this is a hyperfi world with an escape game. And then you can do like challenges so for example one of these is that you find the password to join the discord and then i had to figure out where to go and so if you go to this thing you can click on it and then you have to fill in the password and it's going to take a few minutes, which we don't want to do. I don't know, Pablo, if you want to chat about something here? So I was thinking this would be a really cool thing to do for fun, a bunch of us and whoever else is interested. Maybe one Saturday or, you know, something like world hopping. This is, we are ready. It is in HyperFi. And so I thought that was a really fun thing to do on a weekend. Yeah, actually it would be awesome to have feedback from you guys. We are building these experiences and thinking about how people are going to interact. Teams that work together and we are building some escape rooms. And yeah, here is one. They are pretty much 20 to 40 minutes experience. And they are cooler while playing with peers. And yeah, this is just, you have some clues around and while we are playing with Hyper-Fi and on cyber with both things and yeah, trying to make a fun ecosystem about how we interact with each other together and gamifying organizations, which is what we are willing to do. So yeah, I would be super happy to have feedback from, yeah, you guys, since it's super aligned with what we're doing, everything open source and yeah. So I think last time we had a hackathon on a Saturday, it was seven o'clock in the evening, my local time. So it's three hours from the start of this meeting. Is that a good time to schedule something for this Saturday? Why not? How do people feel about that? Yeah, I can actually do this Saturday? Why not? How do people feel about that? Yeah, I can actually do this Saturday. I'll be in Puerto Rico Sunday through Friday, and I'll be celebrating my wife's birthday next Wednesday, so I don't think I'm going to make it next week. So I'd love to be able to attend this Saturday. Oh, congratulations. Nice. Thanks, Peter. Nice. Good to hear. Thanks, Peter. Yeah, excited. So on the GLTF thing, Matikulak says that something that's annoying me is that there are two things I'd like to bring up to see if they're worth comparing and contrasting with the proposed GLTF interactivity system, but I can only remember where I saw one of them. So I guess, Matikulak, if you want to go into the GLTF spec channel, you can talk about the one thing, and then maybe through chatting you can remember the other thing. As a meta conversation, that's sort of where the visualizing content comes in, that we can link these things in a sort of open canvas way so we can remember okay so listen we won't see you this saturday but i think that link is um or this that thing is available all the time so maybe we can just do one next saturday i'll probably need like three times in a row to get any good at it um all right, then one more thing that I want to share with you is my thing. I want to, I'm going to host sort of a hackathon, conference-y thingy next February, so a couple of months from now in the Zorge. I called it Floating Blue because I couldn't come up with a name and that's apparently what my favorite glaze is called. So this website is very early, please don't share it yet. But the event is going to be about open source play or casual games and earth observation, so it's the things that I'm interested in. And there's going to be talks and hacks and then I was also hoping to have an online component. You know, in-world Twitter spaces, like whatever. So basically just co-hosted with OMI. Yeah, the link is not... I don't even know if it works anywhere else. Also, I broke it because I changed the theme. Anyway, so it's not ready for anything. I just wanted to tell you guys. I was thinking we could use this as a sort of Metaverse festival reloaded, and see where it goes. I'd love to see some of you, or all of of you in person but it'll also be great to have something in world um yeah so anyway so that's what i'm working on um and i think that was everything that i wanted to chat about so there's 15 minutes left if people want to do a demo or just 15 minutes left if people want to do a demo or just share. So Metekulak says one of the GLTF stuff is ROS, R-O-S, which involves computation graphs. And he was wondering how well ROS's computation graphs and GLTF's behavior maps might map onto each other. So this is why I think it's important that we take it slow with the interactivity because I want to ensure that people have the time to actually implement a translator between interactactivity and ROS or Interactivity and Unreal Blueprints or any other visual scripting system. So we can actually make that kind of determination, how compatible is it? So my tech like says the other one is also some, I think that's an excellent point, thanks Aaron, which is probably worthy of a blog person. While the other is also some sort of graph based computation system that I saw on a random web search looking for something else a few days ago but it seems to have gotten lost in a hole in my browser history and I don't remember its name or the search that got to me so so what's the major ones um if there's behavior graphs and ROS what other ones are the major whatever these things are. Unreal Blueprints and Unity Bolts are probably the two most popular just due to how popular those engines are. Anybody got anything they want to demo? Anybody want any help implementing any OMI protocols while we have the best folks asked in the room? I gave a presentation today at MSF's domain leader chair group meeting. And it went pretty good. It was more of the summarization, AI summarization pipeline, which I've improved with 5.3.8 to now I'm using 5.3.14 build model. And it's twice as better in terms of results. But they want me to create a proposal in about a month to have something for SIGGRAPH, I think. And they seem eager to want to also help fund it they just immediately see all the value in um this kind of work for internally and as well as externally how we can engage with uh other uh organizations and companies about what we're working on and just kind of saving time in terms of the minutiae. And like I was reading some notes from a call two months ago at a, I think it was an oversight meeting or maybe a general one. And it was something about how domain or working group chairs should like meet up more regularly and discuss how they can kind of overlap and stuff. And I don't think people really want more meetings you know i think there's another complaint today about just like how you know it was a touchy subject but you know like there's less participation and some principal members you know they um they downgraded to just participants. And, you know, the principal members pay dues, but also it's like, they want to, it was brought up like how results like success breeds success in a way, right? So it's like one really good way to kind of, you know, just having more meetings isn't successful or doing work for the sake of it. So thinking about how we can save time so that there's less meetings and more ability to synchronize with one another about what we're working on. And just making better use of our notes. one another about what we're working on and just making better use of our notes because that meeting basically as i was reading in the notes they were saying how new members could go to the forum portal and check out like the previous uh presentations and transcripts but those are really raw ingredients you know and they need to be cleaned and seasoned and cooked into a more digestible format for new members to be able to get up to speed as to what's been discussed and going on so i almost got it all to one script where it takes all those raw ingredients and processes it into Markdown and JSON files for a knowledge base and then soon some other fun creative presentation formats. And all the data structures are pretty good right now. I combined all the notes into one JSON file per working group. And from that, you can just flop it into a cloud AI with maybe the charter for some context about its milestones and goals. And, you know, like..."}
