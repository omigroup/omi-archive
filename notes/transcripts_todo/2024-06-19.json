Everyone's welcome. We're a community group for indie, grassroots, everyone to make the better metaverse. Does anyone want to introduce themselves or share what they've been up to the past week? Hello, my name is John. Nice to meet everybody. Hey John, welcome. Good to see you here. Do you want to tell us about what you're passionate about? Yes. I am a computer scientist, or that's what I'm majoring in. And very soon I'll be getting an associate's degree in computer science within a year. I love computers. I've always loved technology since I was a kid. And I love computer programming, designing video games, creating 3D models, and many more. And I am very passionate about these kind of things. And I'm glad to be here and being invited by Aaron Frankie. We're very happy to have you here. Yeah, please, please shout out when you... We're very happy to have you here. Yeah, please shout out when you... So we're a very small group, passionate about very different things, and all just coming together and figuring it out together. So no advice is too basic. We're sort of figuring it out as we go along. So yeah, jump in. Right, who else wants to... So my name is Indie. I'm a co-chair and a researcher. And I am interested in sort of the back of the back of how things work. I like the social stuff and the link with the metaverse and the physical world. Like how we look after our resources, and can we do that in a more fun, beautiful, visual way than what we're typically used to in academia. And so I've been learning so much from all the other people here. So I really enjoy this community. Anyone else wanna introduce themselves? Anyone else want to introduce themselves? Or reintroduce themselves? And you're welcome to do it via text or voice. Okay, so Aaron apparently is not home yet. And so he didn't want to... Am I correct that you don't want to do the demo this weekend? Yeah, I mean, if we wait until next week, I'll have my normal microphone and normal setup, so that'll be better, probably. Yeah, no problem. So, we do have a big topic that needs discussion that we're actually going to have on Twitter Spaces tomorrow, and we're welcome to discuss it today as well. What I did, I realized there's been a lot happening, and I'm going happening and meticulous you shared another um link um to the robotics people on discord which i've not added here um but meticulous added a tiny tools directory um and a future tools uh big directories of tools some of which may be useful for us um so that's just sharing this to the group. Open experimental and tiny tools run up. I don't know if you want to add, give any more information there Matikulak, but that's really cool. Thank you for sharing that. And, um, Jin shared a status from Ash Connell who builds worlds in 3Js, which I thought was pretty awesome. I'm a big fan of 3Js, I'm a big fan of web, um, because the way I understand it, it means it's a bit lighter to go. Jin, do you want to share anything about that? Anything particularly cool that you saw? He's been working on making a very optimized sort of just a new take at virtual worlds where creation is really seamless and snappy and you can add things in, and they could instance instantly. You can add interactivity by selecting them. And just kind of outlines this thought process behind some of the various milestones. Highly encourage checking out the thread. behind some of the various milestones. Highly encourage checking out the thread. It's a lot of incredible work, and I'm glad that Ash is getting some well-deserved recognition for some of the stuff he's been sharing in M3 for a while, but now he's finally ready to share more to the world. Really cool. And then you bunched, got across this, because I think he's potentially a sponsor for your art contest. Do you want to talk more about that? Yeah, well, Ash is also one of the people who I started OpenVoxels with. But this art contest is a means to promote interop through art. We converted all these Magical Voxel wearables to GLTF and shared a link to a subset of the data set and are inviting people to create new things outside of the platform, whether VRMs or Blender renders or integrations into other game engines, just to really highlight the potential and benefits and just what you can do once you have interoperable assets. So I'm going to run until the end of the month. And I already got one submission in, and there's cash prizes for top five winners. Awesome. That's pretty cool. Any comments on either of those two links from anyone? That's very proactive. I love it. I already got one submission. That's a good sign that it's early on in that contest and you've already got a submission. I was worried that it would be low engagement, but that may be an indicator that you'll get a bunch of submissions near the end. It usually happens that way, yeah. Gary says Ash is the lead developer of Hyper-Fi. He's a soft engineer and projects. I feel like there's words missing there. He's working primarily on projects for web. That's pretty cool. Oh yeah, also, we're doing a field trip with Ash, and I invited WebXR peeps, but also anyone here. In like eight to nine hours from now, if you want to drop into Gorilla Tag with us to kind of check out what's going on there, because it's kind of been getting headlines, because they announced they kind of passed 100 mil in revenue, which is a major milestone for just any VR title in history. So I kind of want to see it in person. So yeah, later tonight, we'll be dropping in there. Awesome. Do you have a link to that that we can share? I'll share a Discord event in OMI General. Great. From my side, a bit more academic, but I shared my document that I wrote with a few people who's been helping me along the way. And one of my friends he's very pedantic he's you know he loves the semantic web he loves solid so you can just imagine that he's very very active in Debian and so you can just imagine this guy crosses his t's dots his i's and so he was like oh this is great but your references are a mess and so he actually helped me fix those and so he showed helped me um fix those um and so he showed me quarto which is an open source scientific and technical publishing system and so it's sort of a guest like jupiter and stuff but for scientific things and they have a fair amount of mentioning to dynamic content so they can link up with observable and you know they talk about dynamic documents and so I was very excited about this and he yeah so my my document so far is done with quarter and markdown so quarter flavored markdown I don't have these dynamic graphs in and like I would like a 3d map that's in the report and then if you print it you can choose what sort of screenshot to take but I thought this was really nice so just wanted to tell you guys about it and then you also so so we've been working collaboratively on a git repo but he's doing this via radical so it's a radicals and open source peer-to-peer code collaboration stack built on git But it's decentralized and replicated across peers in a decentralized manner. And so we've been testing this out. It doesn't always work 100%, but it's an interesting thing. Kevin Rivelstein was interested in it for his second brain development that he's working on. And so I thought I'll just tell you guys about it as well. I don't know if you've got any thoughts on that. It's not very visual but it's sort of the more semantic side of the metaverse and the interoperability and decentralized aspects of those. Then in another group, if anyone's interested, well, you probably know about this already, but Google has academic research awards and requests for proposals. So if that's something that interests you, there's a bunch of stuff about AI and using AI in like education and climate problems in society. So that looked interesting. And that was I think everything. I think that was everything from what I've found on the interwebs this week. I don't know if anyone else has fun finds to share. Hey, Pablo. Good to see you here. Do you want to introduce yourself? Oh, yeah, sure. Thank you. Well, yeah, I'm Pablo. I'm from Madrid and I'm building an RPE for the Open Metaverse, which is called Numenia and is an RPE that should help people work better and we are very interested on the open metaverse been around the ecosystem since the wave of 2017 and started building in the late 2020, early 2021 and I was searching through my links on the past years and I found this one and it was like, oh, okay, I haven't joined this community. Seems cool. It's aligned with what I'm doing. And I see here some people that I already recognize their names. Let's see them around. So, yeah. Well, great to see you here. Do you want to send us a link of what you're working on? Do you want to show us a demo? It's very good to have you here. Yeah, it's awesome. Yeah. I can send the web page and I can send the web page and yeah, I can show you the demo actually. One of the first mechanics that we are doing is escape rooms. Do you want to show the screen or something like that? Yeah, sure. Okay, I'll stop streaming and then you can show your screen. Okay, cool. Okay, one second. Too many things here. Yeah, much cleaner. Better. Now I'm ready. Is there... Oops. better no I'm ready sir ups one second I might need permission to share my screen oh no here it is okay Okay. So, yeah, this is the company webpage. And we are working on cyber and on Hyper-Fi. And, yeah, we are trying to level up how organizations work. And we have as well Charmverse. Yes. Here is all the documentation and how we are structuring the game. We have two things. One is missions, which is for making the game better. And we have a gamified way of working. And then we have adventures. For example, we can go here and run a little bit around the place. And we have some escape rooms. Let me check. I think I can fly here. Yeah. This is HyperFi. I don't know if you are familiar with these metaverse engines that you have on cyber and HyperFi. And here we have the, this is a kind of escape room, which I would love to have some testers one of these days. And you have to figure out how to get your way out with your friends and kind of steampunk, cyberpunk kind of approach. And we are now starting to license all the code. And I don't know if it's any lawyers around, but we have some doubts on which would be the best way to open source our code. And yeah, we're doing this. That's awesome. I don't know if we have lawyers about code, but we had a very similar question last week about organizational structures. So if you join the OMI Experiments group, there were some hints that I think links to similar questions. And yeah, we're working on it and we can maybe work more on finding better ways to help grassroots people with all these legal challenges. Any questions for anyone else? This looks pretty cool. And I love the idea of escape rooms in virtual augmented reality. I think there's a lot of potential for stuff there."}
