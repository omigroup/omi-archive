I put them in alphabetical order. Yeah, it's more for the bot. Yeah, it makes sense. So the bottom two items on that list there are specifically for the OMI GeoThief extensions repo, and then the rest of them, the top five, are for Git OPRs. Cool. So these are things that are needed to proceed with the implementations and or developments of these extensions. Where do we start? Let's pick one. Do you want to do animation first or physics or gravity? Let me try that again. Do you want to do easier or gravity? Let me try that again. Do you want to do easier or harder? Well, which thing do you think is easier? Visibility is the easiest, I think, on that list. So, in terms of things that are the most ready to go, Animation Pointer is already ratified by Chronos. Visibility is a very new standard from Chronos, but I think it's very close to being ratified, because it's a very simple extension. They're not going to change it from what it is now. So animation pointer, from the Godot point of view, is that it's going to require the import team. It's going to require someone afraid that it will break the animation or whatever. So it will have to go through that review. And then I think that's... It adds new animation, a new part of the code that deals with animating properties via value tracks, which is completely... It already exists, but you're just using it, right? No, the current code actually is only working with position rotations and scale and blend shape tracks. And these are things that Godot has special code for and GLTF has special stuff for. I think it's a good idea. Yeah, I should probably write that down in the comments somewhere. Unless you want to summarize for us. So I renamed the existing track system to NodeTrack because it's specifically referring to node position rotation scale and also like the blending for the meshes and stuff that might be an accurate name because at the like you know the property syntax for the animation player it also works for all nodes like the whole colon property. Yes. But there's a difference between the... Github actually allows you to do both of these things. You can either animate a value track of node colon position or you can animate a position track that just points to the node. Yeah, so calling this node animation or node path animation might be confusing with the node property animation, I guess. That's all. Yeah, I called the new one property track. And it's not new. It's just new to GOTF. It's like an existing system. I'm trying to give you... You know it already has a system for animating properties. I'm giving you points that can be used to argue for this. Okay. So I'm repeating what is already known so uh we could already have a system for animating you know every single property that exists in the node like that you know on the node and yeah so we wanted to um update the geo test system so that it also has this feature. So it's not entirely a new feature, it's just GOTF started with a quote-unquote local solution, and then we're trying to expand it to a global solution because it's required for the animation pointer, animation interactivity, whatever stuff. This is the argument I mean. I'm trying to make an argument for this. And specifically when Fire mentions local solutions, he's referring to just the animation system within the engine that exists for the purpose of being used only with stuff made in the engine. for the purpose of being used only with stuff made in the Engine. But then this is allowing us to import the GLTF animations into that system. To clarify, local solution means within the GLTF module, while global solution would be closer to core or modifying or exactly using the animation system, which is a different part of the Godot engine tree, source code tree. But animation already exists in Godot, so there's already an engine-wide solution. That's why I'm saying it's moving from a local solution to a more global solution, because it's also using the implementation in animation rather than recreating our own solution instead of GOTF as documented. Yeah. I'm trying to give a description of why this is important. Okay, that makes sense. I want to make sure to not confuse people because this PR doesn't actually change anything outside of the GLTF module with the exception of a few lines of code changed in the FBX module to make it compatible with the new internal names. That's fine. The FBX module extends the GRTF module because of reasons. So we actually have to write stuff into the ER for review. write stuff into the ER for review. We have to take notes and stuff, right? Yeah. So I look forward to people reviewing and taking notes. Obviously, I can't take notes on my own PR. Or rather, the notes I have taken are in the description of the PR. Or rather, the notes I have taken are in the description of the PR. Are you okay with being ascribed for today? I said at the beginning of the meeting, I think you didn't have a mic that I'm literally still working. That's not a problem then. Sorry, but I am here to talk if I need to. I can stick around for a long time if we need to wait for Ant to finish work or something. And then I have an appointment right away after this meeting. Oh, okay. I'm super stacked right now. Yeah, well, I mean, let me... Well, we'll just see what the meeting is planned in. I'm kind of in an awkward spot. So I think that because we posted this maybe that we can set up like a proper review next week where everyone is ready to work and it can happen async i think that's also another thing like the discussion can happen it's recorded and like somebody can come in and scribe later. So like, I'm happy to do that later, but okay. That that's thank you for doing that. So I feel like if we're, if we're going to get, if we're going to like review a recording, we could probably like let an AI, uh, scribe and then just have like a human check that check its work. That's, that's kind of what I'm implying. Okay. Totally. Um, I guess we could just talk about it then do you want to drive the screen and we'll look at you presenting it Aaron I could but I will note that because I'm the one that authored the PR like I don't know if I'm the best person to be... So the idea is just go from top and go to the bottom from both the conversation side and the code review. That's what I'm expecting. All right, give me a moment. And what do we want to start with? Do we want to do Animation Pointer first, or do we want to do the others first? Because the others might be a shorter review. You decide. Yeah. Honestly, I think the Animation Pointer is going to need its own reading. So I think I'll start with visibility, probably, because we can go through that one really quickly, because Fire already looked at it. Give me a sec. OK. OK. Thank you. So, visibility, this is the PR for that. It allows you to save into a GLTF file whether you know it is visible or not. The current status quo in GLTF is that everything is visible. So if you have something invisible in your engine and you export it, your two options are either to make it be visible or to set its scale to zero but that can mess with things or you can just exclude it from the export and all those options kind of suck. So this adds a new feature that is being discussed in Kronos here. It's a very simple extension, just a single Boolean and thankfully the way that this Boolean works is exactly the same as how it works in Godot. So this imports node visibility into Godot visibility. Two questions. What happens if it's a node? Actually, is it possible for a node to be invisible in GOTF? Like the Godot version of node, not the GOTF version of node. The Godot nodes can't have their visible set. Only a node 3D or a node 2D or whatever can have their visible set. What this PR does is it uses the generic like the call and the has method for the visible. Yeah. And that way it ensures that it'll work for any node type that has divisible property. Okay. And I assume that, well, that's awkward. Is a non-existing considered true? Yes. Okay, because it's awkward. We're only going to mark things as visible false if they have a visible property and it's set to false. If there's no property, we'll treat it the same as true. That's good. That's both bidirectionally. If there's no property on the GLTF side, we consider it's true. If there's no property on the GEDO side, we consider it's true. So the other thing is we should probably wait. At the moment, this is ratified on the Kronos side. We can definitely prepare for merge. So that's one of the core requirements is that it be ratified so that we don't want it changing on us somehow. Yeah, I'm very confident this won't change, but just as a matter of principle, that makes sense, yeah. So to review, this is something that I would probably write in the comment, but the review is that we should wait until it's gratified before we prepare for merge or approve for merge in Godot whenever. Second thing is that the design of, what's it called? The design of the, when it's not set being, like there's a truth table, we should probably write that down somewhere, where if it's not set, it's true. If it's set to true, it's true. If it's set to false, it's false. Also, I think that's basically it. I can't think of anything. All right, so based on that, I guess we can quickly go over AudioNext, which is also a Kronos namespace extension that has not been approved by Kronos. So is the conclusion the same here then? This has a bigger problem because I am quite sure that the upstream extension will be changing at some point. Yeah. So it's harder to prepare for a merge if it's going to change on the upstream. Yeah. And I don't know what to do about this. It means it's going to get stuck in some minor pause until something happens. Yeah. pause until something happens. Alright, so moving on. For gravity, we need this PR to be implemented to have gravity. Okay, what is the full extension name we're calling it? Oh My Physics Gravity. Okay? All My Physics Gravity. Okay, All My Physics Gravity. So it'll be a Godot-specific extension, because that's what it is right now. It's primarily inspired by Super Mario Galaxy, and it even has features that aren't built into Godot, which is what this PR is about, to allow extending Godot with more features. So, in principle, there should be a PR that implements the GLTF extension and then there's the part that does the engine modification. This is the part that does the engine modifications. This PR has no GLTF extension stuff at all. Okay, so it's a physics engine feature for Godot. So we would have to convince both the existing Godot maintainer and Miki from GodotJolt that this is important. We need an effort from us, the GLTF maintainers and Godot to make the case that this is important. So until the W4 employee, well, contractor employee, whatever, he reviews this, I think this is stuck. Okay. Contractor, yeah. All right, just be sure to let me know if there's anything I can do to make it unstuck. Just ping him. He should be responsive, like in the PR. I'm serious. What was their name? M-I-H-E. H-E? M-I-H-E? They're not on GitHub? Look up Godot Jolt. He might have a different name yeah that person if that doesn't work you can just add him in the just add him in the this person is like they're not on the Github organization so how can they be a maintainer for Github go to just ask him in the message as a message I feel like this is like I don't know if he's even the right person to review this because he's not in charge of the engine he's maintaining a project that plugs into the engine. Well, I think that having a response from him is important. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So there's two Godot physics maintainers, there's Miepi and there's R. Bering. Which you've already told him because he's in the physics team. Yeah. Okay. So moving on then. Yeah. Another PR that I need looked at at some point is this one. Luma has some questions. I don't know if they were solved yet. Luma looked at it and said that I should replace the enum with a string. Yeah. And I did that. Okay. So I'm using a string now. So I guess you can message... Can you scroll to the end? Just slowly. Just message... I recorded for review okay just uh like write a message uh to lioma at lioma uh mentioned that you've converted the enum to a string and i'll message lioma directly This thing is for actually I can, while the message I'm doing manually will be for the notification. Which link is it? Is it import type? 87787. Yeah. Okay. Is there more? Yeah, so let's move on to this one for the OMI GLTF extensions repo. Which adds physics materials and filtering that very closely match the Kronos and Microsoft physics, so we are converging to them. Let me look at the screen again. Can you do that same request on the two people, R. Bering and Luigi? This one isn't Godot. Oh, then never mind. Then it's R. We have to look at it. The people here right now have to look at it. There's me, there's MPB, there's Valid, there's YS, there's Humble Tim. Feel free to help look at this too. We have the link for this. You posted it into the chat message of the weekly meeting. There's that question from There's that question from KHR Basics about why are we repeating their spec, but let's move on. I was going to say that that's the only pending thing here that I think we need to address, right? Right, but what is it pending on? He wrote this message a month ago. Oh, I mean, pending on. I don't know if we should ignore it is the thing i mean okay then how should we respond to it either we ignore and continue what we're doing or some thoughts about it that i want to write but i just don't know if um yeah do we do we want to have like a combined combined response written now by committee? It's not so good, but it would be what we think as a group. I mean, my feeling is that it... I don't know how to put it into words. I don't think we need to be forbidden from doing something because they think it's not right it's one person who has to show up to meetings is the feeling so Owen is telling us to basically cease work on the OMI extension for physics yes without joining meetings or even knowing how we work. So, I'm... Hang on a second, guys. But that's not what it says. It's just an opinion being shared. I don't understand why this... It's the last part. I'd ask you to please reconsider where energy is being. I mean, that is saying, please stop. A single human being on planet Earth is sharing an opinion. The paragraph starts with I. It's his opinion, or their opinion. And even the sentence that says that is their opinion. So it's like they're entitled to that opinion, right? Sure, but I mean, we just have to address it. I'm not saying we have to take it with some massive weight. I'm just saying merging it with ignoring that is worse than having any... Oh, well, okay, merging it without resolving that, maybe, but I really think that prematurely associating authority with comments like this doesn't make sense. It's not that. It's that if this point made is absolutely true, what is our response to that? And our response is that we can't cease work on this because, you know, I'm not saying he has the weight to say this. I'm just saying let's pretend."}
