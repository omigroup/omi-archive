Yep, and I have started the MUSEX recording as well, so that this will be... The meeting is now officially started. Cool. So just tell me things, and I'll do it. Start at the top and just scroll down to the preview, I guess. OMI Phases Gravity Contributor, Aaron Franke, Godot Engine, Status, OMI Stage 1, Dependencies Against the GOTF, Ohmi physics gravity contributor Aaron Frankie, Godot engine status Ohmi stage 1 dependencies against the GOTF 2.0 spec depends on Ohmi physics and Ohmi physics shape there are other physics extensions out there but let's move on it depends on those extensions for per node gravity volumes so you can also use world gravity without those extensions. And this is also trivial to adapt for KHR physics. Okay. So this over-extension allows specifying volume on GOTF nodes, trigger nodes, on triggered GOTF nodes, and specifying the global world gravity at the document level. Global world gravity is always directional from somewhere. It's directional from somewhere. Document level extension may define the magnitude and direction of the global world gravity. Only one or zero instance GOTTF files should have the document-level extension. The intention is to use the document-level extension only on the main GOTTF. If multiple GOTTFs have the document-level gravity extension, use the most recently instanceanced GeoTF models gravity last last GeoTF wins right yeah that's the the logic here like the the intention is that like if you're making a game for each level or whatever you should just have one of these but like if you're loading a new level that you want that one to take priority. Last wins or last instance wins that's a common like LLW is a common term. So we can like mention that. For a per node gravity volume the only physics gravity extension must be defined on the only physics body. So if we want to support other extensions, we would have to define a different extension, something or extend OMI physics gravity on say KHR physics. Yeah, it would be very simple to update this text to say, must be defined on only fixed body node or KHR physics body node that is a base trigger node. Okay. We had that tricky discussion earlier about what is a compound trigger, but I think we've done that. about what is a compound trigger. But I think we've done that. So I just want to mention that thing was tricky for you implementers too. The shape of the gravity influence experience. I'm not reading every single word. Let me try that again. The shape of where the gravity influences experience is defined by the trigger shapes. So this, I interpret this as meaning this is where the gravity exists in the volume. Compared to the global one where it's global and it is if you're in the universe of this GOTF, it just has that property. Whether or not a rigid body is influenced by a gravity volume is determined by the priority replay. That's kind of confusing. I'll probably have to understand that later. It's the same system as Godot's area nodes. I just basically copied that with a slight simplification Godot actually has an enum of like five different options where one of the options is disabled and the other four options are enabled with different replace and stop so for this I figured it's simpler to just have disabled be just not having the extension there and replace and stop are separate booleans which I think is much easier to understand if there's no disabled how do we know say in scripting that we know the properties in that disabled volume I mean good question disabled volume? I mean, good question. But also, how do you disable anything else in GLTF? Disabling isn't a thing that is... It's not a thing that's in GLTF at all. It's either there or not there. You're right. Some people have suggested that you can disable the visuals of a node by just scaling its mesh down to zero. You could just scale down the gravity shape to zero. That's a good point. You have it on, but how can I use what's called animation pointer to turn this off, for example? Right, that's a very good question. Turning it off is not something I have thought about before. Okay, but you said stop setting, so that's why I was thinking about it. There's actually several ways to turn it off, though. You could just also set the gravity amount to 0, although you would have to keep track of that value to set it back later. But for a baked GLTF where you know what that amount is when you're baking the animation point to it, that's not a problem. Yeah. Does anyone else want to? So this is, okay, let me see what this is. I'll read through all of the different settings. The priority unit determines the order in which gravity volumes are calculated with higher values being calculated first The priority unit determines the order in which gravity volumes are calculated, with higher values being calculated first, and the global world gravity is calculated last. The replaced Boolean controls whether or not to keep gravity always ready, calculated so far from the higher priority nodes. The stopped Boolean controls whether or not to continue calculating gravity from any lower oh it's like yeah so it's not a disabled boolean node at boolean value okay no it's a it's a like do when you get to this node the replace is asking do you want to take into account everything that came before and the stop is asking do you want to take into account everything that came before? And the stop is asking, do you want to take into account everything that comes after? So does anyone want to continue to the next section? So that we can also note that these are worded in a way where the like default behavior where they are like both false is where you combine the gravity of all areas together. I think you ought to add this as a technical note for understanding why, I guess. Sure. I guess somebody needs to figure out how exactly to word that and where to place it. I guess I could just add one sentence to that paragraph. word that and where to place it. I guess I could just add one sentence to the paragraph. I'd be okay with that. Anyone want to take a turn on this or I could continue more? Okay. so example. This example defines a scene of a billion-scale Earth planet in space. This is the same as this blah name GOTF except slid down to use only one... Sorry, I'm like reading this, but I'm not reading the exact words that are on the screen, which is bad. But let me try this again. The one related to, this is the same as the Earth million scale GOTF accepts slimmed down to only a single GOTF node. The one related to gravity. It's a fully complete file that can be loaded into any application that can support this extension. So what is the goal of using this example? Okay, so it's in this example, we have the world gravity set to zero to mimic like lack of gravity in space. There's the Earth object with point gravity and a radius of 6.37814. I'm not exactly sure but that sounds like a proportion to Earth's diameter right? It's a one millionth of the radius the actual radius is 6 million meters also Ant can you refresh? Oh what happened? Oh you added something Oh you're pointing to a specific commit so you didn't get the new changes anyway. If you just go to the pull request and click on the branch in the top, they'll go back. I guess that works too. And if you scroll up a little bit, you can see I added a sentence to the end of that paragraph we were discussing, the one above the word example. If only the default settings are used, where replace and stop are both false, the gravity is combined from all gravity volumes in the global world of gravity. So that sentence should be sufficient to explain what happens if you ignore those settings and you don't have them in your file. Do you want to spell that out for ease? I guess. I mean, the sentence is basically spelling that out. Okay. Alright, you can continue. so this is like a simulation of small earth yeah this is GOTF it's a GOTF extension we see that it's the outline of a GOTF extension and that things that note is that we're using the GOTF2 and that the omegraphy is a top level, like we're putting out the top level, the properties. the properties and type okay these are in meters because that's that's what GOTF is and we're using the trigger it's the compound trigger like definition right I don't have lines here under earth gravity. This is just using a single trigger, so there's no compounding or not. OK. But one important note is that the specification specifies that this should be on the base trigger node, which means that if it is a compound, it can only be on the roots of that compound. That way, there's not more than one gravity definition per trigger. Yeah, I remember it was possible to have a gravity definition for every section of the compound. Right, and if you want that, you can just make the... You can just make it not be compound. That is confusing, though. Why is it confusing? Because we already have a system for combining the volumes, right? Yes. But if you want different parts of that volume to behave differently, then they're not the same thing. The whole point of the compound is if you want them all to be treated as one thing. Okay. I'm not actually against this. I'm just trying to understand. I'm just poking at it. Okay. And then we can read this. Scroll down slowly, I guess. Yeah. So this is how we're defining the schema. I guess we can kind of just slowly just look through them. Yeah, we're still here. Yeah, we're still here. So the numbers are always going to be floating points, right? We're going to support all the numbers that GeoSphere supports, right? Thank you. Can teachers start, go from a negative largest number to largest positive number, right? Do we want that for the priority? Yeah, I'm just thinking out loud. I suggest that we kind of scroll through the whole list slowly to get a glimpse. Yeah. Rather than going through each point by point at the start, at least. Yeah. Well, I mean, the tables basically are a summary. mean this the the tables basically are a summary and the rest of the document is just elaborating on the the options that are described in the tables so we could just use the tables just read the tables and then think about then go to the summary so you can read the tables and if you if you don't understand something about the tables, then you can read the extensive prose below. Sure. Which one stands out to you all? Which one would you like to discuss first? Can you just read all the properties one by one, just the name of them? I guess they're tight for now. Me? Yeah. Oh, sorry. Me? Yeah. Oh, sorry. I'm kind of not on the screen. Sorry. I'm just getting caught up here. Where are we at? I don't know. We're just watching. We're just reading the table and just starting from the top and just I'd just say read the property name. I'm going to blast through these then. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Cool, cool. Gravity. Number. Gravity amount in meters per second squared can be zero or negative. Required default. It has no required default, right? Is that what that says? Yes, so if it's required no default that means that it must be specified and we're not going to assume any default value here I was tempted to like assume earth but like I don't want to hard code earth No, no, I don't want us to be stuck here on this planet um we've got to go to other other ones um valid on it's always valid um so then we got the next property direction number it's got three numbers inside of that array the normalized direction of gravity world gravity is always directional an example would be 0, 0, negative 1, 0, 0. And that's our 0.0 to show that it's a float. But you could just pronounce it as 0. I explicitly am writing 0.0 when it's a float and not the 0.0 when it's an integer, just to be clear. Because party is a integer right below it, and that is meaningful. 0 to 1, right? Or something like that. Or no, 1 to, OK, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. As I said earlier, negative max to positive.. All right, and then next we've got type for the type of the gravity. Wait, yeah. Type required, no default, always valid. And then we've got gravity, which is a number, and the gravity amount in meters per second squared can be zero or negative. It is also required, no default. And the next one is priority. That is a number, the process priority of this gravity node, and it must be an integer. And the default value, it does have one, and that is zero, always valid. The next property is replace. And this is a Boolean. If true, replace the current gravity instead of adding to it. And then the default value is false, always valid. Next property is stop. And that's a Boolean. And if true, stop checking more nodes for gravity. Default value is false, and it's always valid. In addition to the type, a key with the same name as the type can be used to define a sub JSON with the details of the shape, which sub properties are allowed depend on which shape type is being used. The possible properties are described in the following table. So we've got a table here that has type, description, default value, and valid on. The first property is... Unit distances description is kind of awkward, I think. It's like gravity. We'll get there. So first one is direction. It's a number. It's an array of numbers, three of them. And it's the normalized direction of gravity relative to the node's transform. And similar to the other default value, it's 0.0, negative 1, 0.0, 0.0 in an array. And it's valid on directional. So this one is only on the directional type, I believe. Is that right, Aaron? Yes. Cool. The next one we have is unit distance. And this is a number. And this is the distance from the nearest point at which the gravity equals gravity. So this is a default value of 0.0. And this is only valid on the non-directional type. I can update the sentence to be a little more clear. the sentence to be a little more clear. But the word gravity, the second instance of gravity here is bold. And what this means is that it's the distance from the nearest point at which the experienced actual gravity amount is equal to the gravity number. So let's say that the gravity equals the gravity value. Or the full number. So let's say that this, which the gravity equals the gravity value. Or the full gravity. The experience gravity. Yeah, or just the experience to gravity equals the gravity property. How about that? Perfect. Okay. Default value 0.0. Yeah, we talked about that. Next up is radius. This is a number, the radius of the circle to attract gravity towards and the default value is a 1.0. And it is valid on both the disk and torus types. Is there a better word than circle? It's like 2D. I don't think there's a way of saying this in 3D, right? Yeah, there is. You could say that the radius of the sphere containing... No, it's not a sphere. It's a circle. It's explicitly a circle. It's a circle. It's explicitly a circle. It's a flat shape. But I've used circle because... Oh, because it's disk and torus. You specify if it's a disk or a torus. This is 2D. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, that makes sense. Okay. Okay, points. Number. And it is an array of numbers. The point that make up the line segments of a line type gravity field, and this is valid on lines, and I assume that these points would, you could have like maybe 20 points and draw like an SVG or something or some kind of like graphic, right? Is that right? Yeah, you could attract to an arbitrary line of your choosing in 3D space. You could just render an SVG and have the character fall towards the edge of that letter. Perfect. Cool. That's a good example. Next one we have is shape. It's a number. It's the integer ID of a physics shape used to define the gravity direction, and the default value is negative one. And it's only valid on shaped types. Alright, so those were all the properties, which ones should we discuss in detail? There's paragraph for each one. Do you want to give us a commentary? Does the group have any commentary on this before we go into diving into it? If you would like to refresh the page, I have updated that in sentence. Or you had to, yeah. Well, just, yeah, go back to the PR and don't click at the top, not files changed. You see at the top it says Aaron Freaky colon, you have that. Then you can go into the folder here, physics gravity in the middle. And then it's here. So now unit distance has some more text in it clarifying. So there's two things that are not in this document. How are there two implementations of this? What are you talking about? Like, there's that spec, and I'm just curious how we can try it out in two places. I haven't made two implementations. I only made one. I am very, very excited to do it. I'm just still stuck on IK. We're so hyped. I'm going to use this for sure. Hyped is great. We could build Super Mario Galaxy into our metaverses. Oh, that'd be really fun. I'm definitely going to be looking into this. As soon as I get this release out, I'm on extensions. To be clear, this is 3JS, right? Yes. Oh, no, not just 3JS. 3JS and Rapier. That's cool. That's very cool. Yeah, that'll be a nice example. And it's so compatible with this. That's why I'm looking through this. I'm like, yeah, I have no issues with this. It's why I'm looking through this. I'm like, yeah, I have no issues with this. It's going to be super easy to use. I think where I struggle with this extension, and the one thing that kind of keeps burning in the back of my mind, is what does it mean for many things to be in the world? I guess, so global versus on a node what does that mean for gravity there is global gravity right I think I understood that part of here is there global is like everywhere in the everywhere in the scene and if it's on a node then that is specifically not everywhere it It is just an area of influence defined by the trigger shape. So would I assume that anything that's a child of that object should have that gravity applied to it? No, that wouldn't make sense because if you're away from it... No, it's not about being a child. Any object nearby that's within the area... Right, right right right it's a property of the world at that point yeah effectively so what we're saying here is that the nodes in the world are affecting the gravity of any object at that location what about if I wanted something to be exempt from gravity? Particularly, like, is there almost like an includes but not an excludes, maybe? Well, there's this replace. That is affecting how gravity nodes interact with each other. It doesn't affect which objects can be affected by this. The assumption here is that this affects all objects. So you know, if you're on some planet in Super Mario Galaxy, the same planets that Mario falls to will also have objects fall to them or enemies fall to them. Everything falls to it. I was thinking you hack it by adding a volume just for that person that changes the gravity for that specific thing on the planet well i've got i've got kind of a use case that i was thinking through that that you've all kind of seen like games that do these this concept of portals where it's like mirror worlds where you walk through it and there's just a completely different place but it looks identical and i was thinking through like how you could have something like that where you walk through and the gravity is totally different but you're still part of that same scene you don't have to you know load a new object or whatever but i guess in that case you would just remove or no i'm not sure i mean actually there is a way to do this now that i think about it uh using just the just the features we have uh in the gltf physics you can just remember we have like uh we actually i haven't wrote this into the omi physics yet but it's there in the the one owen worked on uh the like masks and the layers yes yes that's kind of what I'm describing. You could just say that the gravity volume is not in the layer that the player's being affected by. Or you could just do it with layers and masks. Yeah, that makes sense. And you need to get yourself a hotkey for that so you don't have to keep going i know i know annoying i didn't plan on sharing i have i have a mic with a button not near me understandable all right so um yeah layers and masks will allow you to do that so you can make your your parallel world game where one player changes their gravity to be upside down or something oh yeah yeah that's a great example totally yeah um i think those are the only big questions i had is just kind of understanding the scope of gravity. So how are you feeling about this? Do we want to continue or do we want to continue next time? The next episode of Ovi? I have no objections to this being like if this is already implemented like my my input right now is just questions about my implementation not not opinions about what needs to change so i think the next step is make this officially set as an omi extension stage two i believe and then or no stage one right yeah sounds good uh yeah it'll be stage one. I think everything should start out at stage one, even if we want to advance it after merge. Agreed. And so then this gets to be just a good line in the sand to say, here's what we've got. And from here, if you have questions, if you have implementation problems, bring them up in the meeting and we can adjust. Yeah, and we do want to be sure that this is perfectly understandable. Everybody can implement it. Because obviously, if you have an extension that can only be implemented in a few game engines, that's not very interoperable. Agreed. Yeah, totally. Can we merge this? I'd also like to suggest, in context of validating it, the idea of separately crafted GLBs that contain prioritized gravities coming together into a scene and then emergently interacting by way of how their priorities replace and stops combine. replace and stops combined. Because that's kind of the in the wild kind of scenario, right? It's going to be, it's not like you're not going to define the entire scene as a singleton. It would be the idea of like, you bring in a planet, you bring in a spaceship, you bring in another planet, and then together the only physics gravity kind of kicks in, right? Exactly. So that'll be the like default behavior where everything is like working together because everything's on the same layer by default. And the only reason that you would do anything differently is if you explicitly add layers to make it not that way. So by default, everything will play together. Cool. Do we want? Oh, yeah, here we go. What do we got? We have a vote, right? Five votes, yay? All right. Yeah. So there's no reason not to merge this, right? Well, it needs an approval. I got you. Oh, actually, Liam did approve it, but it's better if more people do. I did see it, but yeah, I will approve it. It's nice to have two reviewers. I'm not going to do all that. I also spent like an hour just finding the optimal settings for some of these PNG files or JPEG files or whatever to make sure they're not too big but don't look bad either. I'm just going to blast these real quick just to make sure there's no file. Oh, here we go. That's what I want. Yeah, this includes a bunch of test files, and there's a good implementation. Awesome. Yeah, let's get this in so we can start using it. Not rock. Thanks, Dwayne. And yeah. We'll merge it. Can't stop me. Woohoo! Fireworks! I wish it would. Oh, there's some places where if you press enough reactions, the whole screen tends to convey I think we should get some at least a post about this on the Twitter account how do we do that I don't know but I feel like implementing it would be a good you're right show it it off, right? Mario Gravity Post. Okay. Show it on the Blackpots, because we can. Man, it's going to be so cool to do this. So what I'm thinking is I've got... I've been playing around with just this idea of jumping puzzles. I really want to get jumping puzzles where people people can you know jump yeah so you do like a jumping puzzle where you go upside down or go on the side or something but like if you barely miss it you miss it it's so it's so so annoying um like yeah so that kind of stuff is going to be fun to implement gravity with on this and then having things like like if you if you jump to a platform like maybe maybe at that point it like flips upside down and i'm attached to that that'll be really cool and have like uh jumping puzzles that flip upside down yeah um yeah that'd be cool. Also, you know the layers you were talking about? Yes. Fire was asking how to disable it. You could just make it on no layers. Oh, interesting. So just keep swapping it around? Yeah. Putting it outside of the common ones. Not in the same layer. Yeah, I mean, I think it's possible in the layers to just say that it's not in the layers, right? Or you could just put it on an unused one. Like you put it on the last layer, for example. Yeah, this is this is what I've been doing the last few days is trying to get hands it's hard really really really hard oh well I've always wondered about gravity in VR it's really hard to even about gravity in VR it's really hard to even use gravity in VR is it people who fly and have planes really like it though when I played those games oh okay so you can be in a thing that has or is influenced by gravity. It's just impulse, right? It's just your physics impulse. I love what Humble Tim posted in the chat. Oh, I was actually going to ask if it makes sense. So, there's just one thing that is not quite right here. Usually the expectation is that larger gravity volumes have a lower priorities that are processed last. So like the AI generated output here, which I assume this is, gave the big planet 1,000 and the moon 500. Probably would make sense to have those be the other way around. Or even making the big planet a negative priority or something. I was actually... The replace and stop interactions, I didn't, I still don't understand fully, but they kind of seemed like blending parameters, like for alpha blending almost. And so I was kind of trying to ask the AI to help break it down in some other example for me. But I also see here that Gaia is set to stop equals false. So it's basically like a center of the universe kind of thing, where its gravity becomes stopped by other scene elements, right? But what happens when two things have stopped false? Or two things have stopped true? It's just, do you have to take the order of loading then into account to understand what happens, it sounds like? No. Well, yeah, so that's what the priority is for. So the priority determines what order you're checking them in and then the first one you get to that says stop you stop so if if you have gravity shapes a and b and a has a higher priority than b then a will be processed first if a says, then you don't even look at B. What would you imagine as the most organic factoring for a planet and its moon? I don't understand. Would you actually, I don't understand, like, if stop, false, or true creates like a sentinel endpoint, right? Then does that mean your relationship to your home world basically has to be taken into account? So you would create like a solar system kind of view rather than like a galactic view? You know what? Let me write something here. Before you mention anything, I was actually just about to remove that message because it just came out really awkward and discord markdown. Really? I mean, aside from the physics getting italicized, what was wrong with it? If I stare at it and let my eyes glaze over, it's like there's too many asterisks. I see. It didn't get rid of the symbols for the formatting, in addition to doing the formatting. And then if I had it unfolded, it took up like three pages. But I do think it would be helpful for me and others to find some sort of easy to grasp kind of way to visualize some of these interactions at the scene level to build up intuition on replace and stop in particular. you Cool. So next steps, I think, are play around with it, get some implementations. And it sounds like for those who had to go, maybe revisiting a couple of these things at one of the next meetings could make sense too. Like just the changes that we're making. Totally. Cool. Well then I'm going to go and stop the recording. Stop recording. And yeah, thanks for joining."}
