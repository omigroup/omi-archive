For example, in MSF, we've been having pretty low attendance, even in some of these more popular groups or topics like characters and avatars and digital fashion for wearables, and the GLTF extensions meetup. It's also been kind of struggling to attract new attendance, which is important because we need to get feedback and we need contributors for implementations of extensions, for example. implementations of extensions, for example. So all of this is just trying to feed into the content machine for better sort of awareness and promotion of our activities, what we're currently working on, how people can contribute, where to find us. I agree with that. And then I see the lightning talks as a complimentary, like very polished, short delivery of someone's idea, you know, along the line of being a trumpet for our members. So sort of like a mini TEDx talk. But I agree with everything that Jen's saying as well. But I agree with everything that Jen's saying as well. Okay, well, does everyone have access to the web repo called recordings? Is it able to see it, download it? Sorry, what's it called? It's in the chat. It's just called recordings. I linked it in the chat. I'm able to see it. I had to go find it in the, I think you just spaced it again, but it was in the general chat. Right. So I'm not quite sure because MeSeeks bot basically for context, MeSeeks, this is a Saturday sort of meetup that is not one of the weekly meetups, just for the transcript. And one thing that I don't have organized in that repo is what recording pertains to what meeting, whether it's the weekly or Geoosafe extensions or something else during the week. So it would help to kind of prompt, you know, with what I use is Cloud 3 because it has a huge context window, but feel free to use whatever. But ask it for basically, can you summarize, can you tell me which meeting this pertains to? Give me a bullet point summary of what was discussed, what questions asked, and what action steps are being taken or planned for. And that should give a pretty good highlight sort of overview for each JSON. and then we can better organize things. Maybe just like taking that markdown and, you know, saving each one as a markdown file, and then processing those again for more of a higher level summary from the kind of meta context of all the meetings. You know what I'm saying? That's actually quite a popular system to do multiple summaries, back-to-back-to-back summaries. So that's distillation is, you know, there's archive papers about how that's what a good pipeline looks like today. And just for austerity, the event leading to this gathering was Lightning Talk Prep Hackathon. And the description, which Misa said I don't know if has access to, was a hackathon to prepare for our lightning talks, to talk through end-to-end of the talks, a few trips on how to present a few tips on how to present some practice runs to give us something to practice for recording on and just to have fun together. So it sounds like maybe, Jen, you're proposing an extension of that where a curation effort maybe and to augment the metadata, like to associate the particular meetings that go with the database of recordings, right? data like to associate the particular meetings that go with the database of recordings right um is that that sounds interesting too but also like not the same as the lightning talk idea so does it kind of would it benefit from kind of being its own initiative in name sure it it just kind of relates back to the overall goal, right? Which is the promotion, spreading awareness, marketing, you know, where, you know, it helps to kind of see the full pipeline. Exactly. And that's kind of where my mind is going to. Who do we imagine doing this work? And, you know, resources lining up for the, like, if successful, right, if marketing and improving attendance is successful, it seems like we would need to ramp up volunteer resources in order to accommodate that. How do we see that kind of fitting into that big picture? One of the things I had looked at, it's not on the scope of lightning talks, but it's doing spaces. And that would be as kind of a way to open up to a wider audience and recruit people into one of the work groups, know as a at least average and especially if we were doing things like a lightning talk but again something a little bit more scheduled so that you can say anybody who's interested the on my group is having a lightning talk next wednesday at you know 245 whatever the story is and that becomes something that then is uh shareable but uh it's an example of what you're talking about yeah yeah no i it sounds like there's this con this um a distinction maybe like like we could like with subgroups right we kind of imagine like this github template and like this progression right but it kind of sounds like the technologies evolved to a point where we could almost imagine the gathering itself as kind of the first class construct right and then like if someone was willing to uh engage um as an mc and host of like a twitter space or a recorded um gathering of any kind that could kind of gathering of any kind, that could kind of feed into this recording automation distillation process rather than, not instead of, but as a parallel to some of the other formalities. So maybe we wouldn't need as much of that volunteer overhead time because it would kind of boil down to putting on the gathering and then we would trickle the value into other things using this technology absolutely i can see that being a little more fun and inviting for for folks to uh to put on such things uh people will always catch the recording. There will always be more traffic to the content afterwards than the live event. And if you want, I could drop a zip of the transcripts, but I'm just going to see what Claude comes up with, if we can better organize these things because even if we were to do lightning talks right or events of this sort um it would help to also like come up with some fresh content to uh invite people to that event anyway so may may as well process what we've got. Here's the zip. I'm just going to see if Claude can help out with summarizing and organizing based on.. And that link was 404-ing for me, by the way, just as information. Not interested necessarily in fixing it, but just FYI. Yeah. So Gary said that as well, and I'm wondering if it's a permission thing that if you can access. But I mean, I think if you can access the meetings, then you should be able to access this one. It works for me. You got to be on the GitHub org. Okay, so can we just add people like Jimmy and Gary or do we? Yeah. Okay. So I just want to check in. Hamilton, are you happy with the way that this is going? want to check in. Hamilton, are you happy with the way that this is going? Because I do think perhaps you and me had a different objective with this hackathon today, but I also appreciate that what Jen and Jimmy wants to do is also very important. So I'm happy to go with either, but I just want to make sure if you're okay. when i see the word uh hackathon i try to come in not expecting exact science right so i think it's i think it's fine to to explore whatever direction ever seems seems best to everyone i i do hold um i've seen i've seen things i've seen too much and so like i love the idea, right, of increased awareness, marketing, and greater attendance. But then I remember how sometimes when that happened, if you really care about this community, right, it's like you have to start giving up your time because nobody else is making time available, right? And that, I think, is one of the sources of burnout, right, when we don't account for this when we're planning. So as long as we're talking about everyone here today being the resources, right? Not imaginary phantom resources of the future, which we don't qualify yet. But as long as that's what we're talking about, then I could see it being fine. But if we're imagining things that exceed the scope of what our personal availabilities are here, then we're talking about other human beings having to fill that. So having some methodology and strategy to ramp that up in parallel, to me, kind of becomes really critical too, if that makes sense. Yeah, definitely. And so that's why I'm very happy to carry on with the vein that Jen and Jimmy is talking about, because that's exactly about how do we use AI and all these tools to make it as efficient as possible. So that's why I'm happy to carry on in that vein. And then maybe we can do the stuff that you and I have been chatting about at a later date. I do would like to have it as a hackathon and not a private conversation. But that's cool for now. So let's carry on. So Jen and Jimmymy you lead the show anyway perhaps we can take a so we can like do the end-to-end run through with one of the meetings and then see if we can exit with a with a blog post by the end of it because you know i'm i'm very happy to contribute to this and you what you were saying is I asked you what a weakness was with the previous thing that you were documenting. And the weakness was the last bit, like getting it out. And so I want to help with that, but I need to learn how to use the tools effectively. So great using this hackathon. Off you go. Yeah, chat you go. Do you have chat GPT? What? Would it maybe be helpful to put the finish line on the table? Like a bullet point that says, hey, like we're aiming for, you know, the outline of a blog post or something and then have that be the one bookend. And then because it sounds like we're starting way down in the weeds here and it sounds like it could turn into anything. But if like you want to cross the finish line in particular, it may make sense to put that pin out there, even if it's movable for now, you know. Absolutely. And I don't want to cross the finish line in particular, it may make sense to put that pin out there, even if it's movable for now. Absolutely. And I don't want to be here till midnight. Yeah, I would like a blog outline. And I think, Jimmy, you're probably a good person to suggest stuff as well. And we can maybe pick one of the recent meetings and see what we get out of it. And if it's a terrible blog outline, that's also a result. It doesn't have to be one that we're going to publish. So for the transcript, Jen is opening one of the recordings from the transcribed OMI community meetings and seeing the text. And then what are you doing, Jaden? Putting it into Claude. Maybe I should just convert all of them to text. Because maybe the formatting, it's getting confused. So maybe it's confused by the timestamps. I mean, this is really useful, especially if you wanted to do video editing. But this format doesn't work well in terms of processing these. So I need a new prompt. This might sound like a step backwards, but if this were like a programming challenge, right, working with all these variables, I would go through it as a human once to survey the landscape, like to basically operate role play cloud, right? Like pull up the transcript, right? Review it as a human, see what I might expect as a distillment, right? And we could practice the whole kind of process that way, and then perfect the tuning with the LLMs later. Because it sounds like this is a prompting challenge, kind of also where there's gonna be a little art and science to make sense of it, which is fine. But, you know, if we have to guess all that as we go here, I don't know how far we're going to get. All right. Give me some prompts. Do you want a zip? Do you have all these text files to try? Well, what I'd really like is to be able to visualize in my mind what this looks like end to end. Like I understand the building blocks, right? But these are general purpose building blocks. You could literally prompt anything to anything, right? So that doesn't actually help remove the other possibilities that are coming to mind. But what would the distinct end-to-end workflow here? We know on the one side, right, we might have, like, a blog outline output or something. We know on the one side, right, we might have like a blog outline output or something. We know on the initial side, we have some raw material, but are there any milestone steps in between that we could anticipate where as bulkheads almost to kind of compartmentalize and solve some of these inner problems like prompting? And then this is also a lesson of, you know, perhaps there's stuff that we need to say in future meetings to make it easier, you know, like a book that we suggest. So what we already have is fun finds every week and demos and working group updates. Would that help to categorize stuff? The more organic stuff, I don't know. Oh, maybe we could do a month in review for April. Like something high-level like that that could be a little broader prompting, maybe. These currently look very verbatim. These currently look very... Verbatim? Here's what I can do. I can just combine it all and just, you know, like... Nah, that would be too much for Claude. You know, it has a big context window, but it's not like it can give me all the deets of everything. It's a lot of text. I'm set up to just pump stuff into the million-bond text Google thing, but when I did that for code, I found that the correspondence of source code to tokens was not quite what I expected, and to fall in under the million mark was difficult but I don't know how many words or tokens we would have here but maybe maybe a million is enough to handle all of April I don't know I'm trying that tool that I have been playing around with and I'm just about to ask it if it can take the whole zip file as a single unit and do that would be nice so I'm just checking that right now so from my side so I tried to do transcripts for the last three meetings um to get some thoughts from the filming community about the library project. And I get bored because I hate listening to myself and then I get distracted. Anyway, I think what I would like from an AI is if I go through the transcript or the audio myself as a human, and then I go, huh, at the 11th minute, we're having a really good conversation. Could you summarize what we said? So it's more working with AI with a lot of human intervention than doing the whole thing. Have you found an LLM interface that kind of speaks timestamps like that, that understands those kind of questions? Also, on the one hand, you're bounding, so the human is bounding it, say, like, summarize what happened between minute 11 and minute 13, because that was a good conversation. But Hamilton, actually, so you've been pushing our chats on the DMs through an AI, right? Because after we checked, you found it. Oh, no, I haven't done that yet. I had the original back. This was last December, I haven't done that yet. I had the original backup. This was last December, I think. At the server at that time, there was attacks going around, and pretty much everything was on our Discord server, so I tried to take a backup. The only way to make a backup is you're not supposed to. But I then said, okay, I'll take the general channel and just see. But the ingester I was using with private GPT or whatever locally, it just did not work at all. It got it couldn't even get facts right it couldn't get who said what right it couldn't i couldn't do sentiment analysis so i kind of set it all aside but it's been in a huge amount of time in technology space terms like the ai tools have they just keep doubling so i think that it could be possible to that we're at that point um but it still seems very manual and touch and go but jim you got pretty good stuff out from firefly didn't you i thought so we don't know if it's good anymore we would kind of have to go back and maybe we have to actually like see the good stuff and then go back as a human and say oh yeah that actually that reflects what actually happened it isn't just hallucination right which i already feel is very useful um so that's how i did the i don't know some other meetings are generally summarized uh the gltf group is recording and they um there, in my mind, it's like this glaring flag that there should be celebration about Aaron's work with the gravity stuff. I mean, there's a really cool demo, right? But it's kind of in the episodic or situational participation mode. It's kind of in one of its limbo phases. episodic or situational participation mode. It's kind of been one of its limbo phases, but it would be something concrete that we could aim for to publicize and promote only. That's super cool. And also things that can be made visually presentable and non-technical ways, you know? So that's exactly my idea with the lightning talks. It's to get Aaron in a room, you know, build a talk with him. So that's what I did with my TEDx events. And you groom the speaker, you help with their content, you have a fuck ton of work. But you can use that talk. The mileage that you get out of that recorded published talk is insane. Well, I think two people tried recording. Because I told Aaron how great the first presentation was, even though it was kind of, he said ad hoc. But the second one, I thought at least two people chimed in and said they recorded the video for. Maybe the raw materials are already here somewhere in the recording space. I think Jeremy recorded and I tried to record as well. I can try and put that somewhere. The thing is just, so I get, so that's quantity over quality. What I was aiming for with this original idea of the lightning talks is high quality short talks. That really you can use for a couple of years. You know, they've got traction for a couple of years. They've got traction for a couple of years. And someone like Kim, who just isn't a very good communicator, but has an excellent project, you really need to work with him and get him on a good day when he's not in a bad mood. When you record that, it's really, really good stuff. Money comes from that. People watch that and get funding. Oh. Is that a layer of, is that like one of the layer of objectives that could inform kind of our preparing kind of from the recordings? Like is that, are a lot of people seeking grant money and things and who would be doing these lightning talks i don't know about a lot but a few yes um you know like i want to get my project going and i don't know how to do it um kim is running out of money like he's literally he's struggling and there's a bunch of people as indies were always so you know just on the precipice of getting like being poor um so yes i would say like so i mean yes this is a it's a sort of dangerous thing to do because you don't want to chase the money but in my experience the good people don't mark themselves enough whereas the people with absolute snake oil to sell present themselves so well. And so I just want to change that balance a little bit. any folks on the other side of that equation who were particularly affable and might be able to lend some expertise and advice on how we could assist some of these underrepresented projects and people in a way that would meet with what they're looking for? Because it seems like there's a different kind of lightning talk format that could be used or something that would meet with what they're looking for? Because it seems like there's a different kind of lightning talk format that could be used or something that would work better or worse, depending on what you're going for. And if the people who are looking to invest through grants and stuff, if they have kind of particular things that they need to check on their list, and we could somehow help the underrepresented voices check off those things through this process, that seems like that would be useful and mutualistically beneficial. I mean, I think I'm one of those people. But it's also like incubators and pitch competitions, they've got preparation and a lot of those things you can find online. And I think the TED Talks are based on that as well, you know, so it's, you're talking about the benefits, you know, you focus less on the technology, which of course after a while just falls over, and then it becomes a motivational talk, which is, which sucks, but less about the technology, and more about the benefits. Can it make money? Because what we all do as technical people is we carry on about the technology and why it's so good, but we don't say why it makes people's lives better or easier. Gin's probably an exception. You're really good at selling why it's so cool. I did a bit of that like 10 years ago. I could probably brush up. And there's a bunch of speaker coaches out there. We could find more people. But I think the way to do this is to start doing it and then sort of show your vulnerability that it's not the best you can do, but it's something because you're indicating intent. And then that should get more people to reach out. Basically you're saying, look, this is what we want to do. Can someone help? Yeah, it's probably something to do, hey? Something to reach out on well yeah i also think that that's that's one of those um dimensions that uh it's a double-edged sword and um like being mindful of it like here maybe counterintuitive but i actually think it would be more transparent to kind of just posture the whole exercise in that dimension. Like imagine a, not like not only as someone who gives out grants or anything, but as just a place where these kind of lightning talks, imagining seeking support, right, have a natural presence that is not confusable with other things, you know? Like if someone's wanting to seek investment for their idea, that it's not represented as, oh, here's this standard for everyone and the greater good, right? Because then that creates confusion and can create resentment, right? But if it's just honest about it, right? Like, hey, we're helping independents, you know, find resources. Then I think it fits in way more naturally. Yeah, absolutely. So while you're talking, I'm thinking about a stand-up night. And I guess that's what I sort of all like. And that's the definition of lightning talks. So generally at conferences, there's like five in a 15-minute session, and you stand up and it's three minutes, and you basically say what you're working on um and what you need yeah but so so that sort of greater strategy is what i'm wondering about with the linux foundation as well um yeah you're totally on the right brainwave well same brainwave as I am. And I think to do that in a virtual world is pretty cool probably. You know to have like these stand up a Pecha Kucha comes to mind. You know there's like a bunch of stuff stuff of these that happen in the real world. I don't know if they're popular all over the world, but in Cape Town we had Pecha Kucha, we had First Thursdays, we had TEDx events. And they sort of, you know, you have a few people speaking and it gets recorded and it gets published but then you also just have it as a networking event. Really cool. Then after a while it sort of got infiltrated by bullshitter and it sort of died like there was less um focus on the quality than on motivational speakers i don't know why i mean. But anyway, the point is there was this magical period that literally is like the best time of my life. It was 2011, 2012. And I guess in a way I'm trying to look for that back, but in the digital sphere, because I don't want to fly all over the world. I don't want to be limited by my geography and I don't want other people to be limited. And so I guess that's one of the reasons why I'm excited about the metaverse. Yeah, I mean, one thing I've observed that seems to yield those kind of outcomes is, I guess, maybe a content vacuum where, like, if an org says, hey, every month we're going to come out with a blog article, but then it's only episodic participation. And it's like, well, what do you do? You could scramble to put something out, but then suddenly something kind of looking okay, right, comes through and you're like, well, maybe. And then like the curation integrity kind of starts to erode in favor of the cadence, right? So probably finding something here that balance that somehow, you know, like if there's lulls, not just filling it with filler, but maintaining the integrity, even if that means gaps. I don't understand what you're saying. If you start, you can see this in individuals. I don't know. I've done a lot of this stuff in M3, by the way. We've done demo days in virtual worlds. We've done a lot of this stuff in M3, by the way. Like, we've done demo days in virtual worlds. We've done these transcripts. We've done these. Several times I've scheduled on the calendar to attend one of your demo days. And for various reasons that are understandable, right, it'll get canceled last minute or something like that. And that's fine. However, as someone, like, who practiced what it might be to be, like, a user at large, right, like, oh, I'll list my calendar and I'll go. I struggled to get into some of those events. And also, sometimes the events, they can be so open-ended that you don't really know what you're going to expect. So it's hard then to kind of reconcile that. It's hard. I'll just say that doing virtual events takes work, effort. Doing virtual events takes work effort. As far as I know, I'm one of the only people in M3. Probably also owe me to have a lot of experience scheduling and kind of being behind the scenes of such. And there's a lot of logistics, like probably 10 hours of work that goes into doing something that, you know, you want to value people's time. There's a lot of preparation and post work to make it worth it. And, uh, you know, like that's kind of stuff that I feel needs, that's good use of budget. First off, you know, like I'm the only one who didn't burn out and I sought to fix that issue. That's not my assessment, but I guess I could see that thinking that like just last week I was on a inter-universe virtual world field trip. And there were 20 some people all flying vehicles around like idiots, right? In simulation. And every time that that safari happens, there's that behind the scenes effort. You know, this Thursday, who I only kind of know through online, I don't think she's been to OMI, but she runs this weekly safari, right? And it's an incredible amount of work. And it also depends on the metaverse itself kind of working, right? Like, cause you're dragging 20 people between independently operated things. And so i understand um and appreciate all that value you're putting in i hear um when we talk about scaling multiples of that 10 hours though like if only decides hey we're gonna do this and we're actually gonna do it like four times as often as we were that sounds like 40 hours right there. And yeah, if you could find resources to fill that, that does sound like a good use of budget. However, that's the concern that I feel like isn't really being allowed on the table here, that by suggesting these things, we're basically deciding effort that needs to be done by other people or ourselves. So if we're already kind of at our own limits, this is a critical problem that needs to be solved by other people or ourselves. So if we're already kind of at our own limits, this is a critical problem needs to be solved, right? It can't just be let's all vote to do it and then have no resources lined up, right? So I agree with both of your points. And from where I'm standing, to me, it looks like there's a lot of pieces in place. And there's some gaps that if we fill the gaps then it'll happen smoothly more smoothly one of the gaps um is in my mind is that we're limiting our audience to very technical people um to very it technical people and the thing is that a lot of people who are really good with these logistics stuff they don't have to be it technical you know they could be a grandma they could be you know someone who does like maybe who just is a graphic designer and who wants to sort of get into this thing and so that's why my i'm trying to grow the audience beyond people who are technical um trying to grow the audience beyond people who are technical. And then the other thing is that I think just to support Jin is, I think he's using a lot of the, Jin, what's your pronouns? Just he. Okay. He's working on a lot of tools that makes it easier. And so it doesn't go from 10 hours to 40 hours. It goes from 10 hours to 20 hours, which is still a lot. But really, we're in this sort of scaling issue where you're trying to go bigger to get more people to help you run the events. But it takes effort to grow bigger in the first place. Oh, the other thing I wanted to say is the thing that drives people that prevents burnout is what's in it for me. So I like scheduling talks and getting people into talk because I'm growing my network. And so for me, it's pulling people in. You know, there's people that I have in my inbox that i would like to have give a talk and i'm willing to work and badger them until they give a talk um and so that's what i enjoy doing and so so i'm less likely to burn out doing that because i like doing it and so you have to work with what people are passionate doing and then enable and empower them to the base of your ability so on i i'm watching what jen's doing too i'm i'm doing something so i've shared the screen uh and it's just this uh app that i've got now so i i had to go grab my anthropic key that i didn't have so i had to reissue one and uh i only uploaded one of the transcripts and it seems like it was one of the earlier ones so i think it might be nice to see what people were talking about in uh the date that i was able to pop up there but if you're interested in that's what I'm doing right now, is answering the questions that it asks me. And you were talking about what's easy and what's, you know, this could be used by, you know, 13 year old, you know, to do their, you know, book report if they wanted to. It's really quite simple. Once you get that baseline up to this point, for instance, and that's not super difficult and it just asks you a few questions it says how much it's good estimates how much it might charge for the service and then it spits out and again this is where i have the problem with it it spits out a little too much for what we're interested in because it's a it expects you to host this result standalone on your own on a versatile web hosted uh site for instance as a next js project um but i am going to go through it just for the hackathon portion of it. That sounds great. Thanks, Jimmy. And I just realized this, what you just said is already a very good piece of content to deliver. So could you tell me what tools you're working with for the sake of the transcript and for the sake of sharing this? you know it's a tool called lumentis l-u-m-e-n-t-i-s from a guy out of singapore uh who publishes a lot of stuff that he does online he's done some interesting thing with retrieval augmented generation and this is a kind of a side project of his that they have released what it does is takes any input data that you throw at it text-based it seems like and then it will do a short summary website out of it. So it's also asking me questions now, like, do you have a short description of the source? Who's talking? What type of content? And I'm going to go into it. It asks, who's talking? What type of content is it? I'm saying it. This is a recorded discussion uh between a metaverse 3d technology enthusiast group group uh set up to promote Open Metaverse. I assume it will take that title. Great. Great, and what we're trying to do here at this Open Metaverse Interoperability Group, or OMI, hackathon, is to develop tools to better get content out from our community meetings to share with the wider world, and have an archiving function. Join us on Discord. Okay, and then this is probably something that we could edit as an example and take it out. And now I'm wondering if there's a prompt that we can include in the transcript that makes it easier for us to find this future. Like what sort of special keyword or safe phrase could we use to you know if somebody if somebody does something and then after the fact we can say hashtag this and this um and then we can use the prompt to find that you know when we want to work it up later uh i don't know where this is. It's somewhere. iFire and I ran some experiments. I think it was on a Discord or a GitHub somewhere. But with the idea of basically I just wanted to go through and leave a little newspaper icon on any mentions in the Discord that were potentially newsworthy when I was taking on the responsibility for preparing the agenda for the town hall. Because there would be things discussed, but they would scroll away. Right. when I was taking on the responsibility for preparing the agenda for the town hall, because there would be things discussed, but they would scroll away, right? And then there'd be this blank canvas effect preparing the agenda last minute. So I was like, oh, if I could just drop these little things and then somehow search for them later. So we looked at trying to automate some of that, and it didn't quite work out. But I think the idea still has merit of something super simple that anyone could kind of just earmark right um and then we could sit through that especially like with llms or even ourselves somehow um i don't know if that makes sense but it sounds like similar to yeah absolutely so when i see stuff um you know whatever then i just generally dump it in the GitHub agenda. I'm trying to get people to do it as well, but it tends to be just me, which is fine. I'm more thinking about if you have a recording and then you then process. So that what you talked about for the Discord, but in the video recording that we can insert to like a hashtag or something that'll be easy to find. Yeah, like the sound clip marker they use in films to earmark the sound point you know the little clapper but i want something like arbitrary silly like baby guinea pigs i think you just look for that yeah on the baby guinea pigs clearly this is foremost in my mind, should we have a channel of just sharing pig pictures on our server? I resonate with the idea of that inquiry being put forth? How was it decided what channels, is there a way to make a list of channels that could be interesting and like? The main thing was that the other servers were that was too busy. and so we tried to reduce it to the absolute minimum. And so what we did is basically just use the active ones. And so we tried to reduce it all down to just general and GLTF extensions, because that's an active working group. And then anything else, we decided to go into a thread in OMI experiments. And then there's some automated channels. Watching the blossoming effect of Burley-OMI into those channels, like, it wasn't accidental. Like, it just wasn't priority. Like, if someone had some, priority. There were points where someone would come in with energy, and so it would kind of be like this pouncing effect of setting up a GitHub, setting up a channel, right? But then it kind of would not be followed up on. So I'm not convinced that it's too many channels as like the root cause kind of there i i think it's more um uh channel relevancy as a general conundrum you know and um and also uh across time through through situational participation modes you know where you might have laws so it looks like something's not moving but it might actually just be um you know the that phase of um its natural heartbeat you know it's rhythm so uh i don't know i think the idea of channel relevancy is a really useful uh anchored into all sorts of other kind of dynamics to consider yeah absolutely um and i think a lot of people so i asked new people when they joined and like to the last person everyone was it's very confusing to join and what i realized um just looking at the omf thing is if you check in often then they all the inactive channels just go gray and so it's not a problem to you know pick up where you left off because the ones like i see media has new ads and only um gltf extension has new apps and the rest are gray so it doesn't matter but if you come in new it's just too much it's just too much and so and then we didn't I mean it just it needs periodic maintenance as well and we didn't want to do that on the angel server because we were migrating out to a dedicated one because that gives a stronger brand name but yeah it is the nature of things. You just need periodic maintenance. I think descriptions on channels are always useful, but if I went to the top of a source file, it's hard to turn into a community habit. file, it's hard to turn into a community habit. Hey, my quad, I need more tokens, but I'm just going to try and run some local LLM type stuff on these. And I forgot I had to do something. It's at the hour, so I'll post some updates as to summarization later. Jimmy let me know how it's going on your end later some of these are big ass transcripts and are taking up a lot of tokens so just be wary of that. Probably best to do it one by one also to get better details overall summarization but yeah I'll catch you all later also to get better details, overall summarization. But yeah, I'll catch you all later. Great. Do you need to go immediately, or do you want to do a minute just catching up, like talk us through what you did, you know, and sort of think about it as a recording that can go onto the social media? I organized, I converted the transcript files to just pure text, wrote a bash script that can basically prepare the text files for all sorts of processing into LLMs, and now at the stage of processing transcripts through an LLM and then basically copying the summarizations, bullet point notes into the OMI group HackMD, which contains meeting notes from all the previous meetings that we've done. Thank you, Jin. Jin is one of the very active, very passionate members of the OpenMetaverse Interoperability Group. And you also recently won a Developer of the Year award. Which one was that? Yeah, that was WebXRDev 2022. Awesome. I appreciate all the work that you're doing. So come chat to Jin and join us in our Discord, the OMI OpenMetaverse Interoperability Group. Thanks, Jen. See you around. Thank you very much. Yeah, I need to carry on. Okay, Jimmy, over to you. We're just at, hopefully, the tail end of this application producing. So it's gone through and asked me a bunch of questions. So right now it is just now producing the results. So it's heading back to Claude. It's a combination of the haiku, and I selected the middle ground, the sonnet. I don't know if you guys can see my screen, but I'll show you the history that got here. We basically initiated the tool, this Lumentis thing. You just press npx Lumentis and then it asks you to provide a text block to look at. I just gave it one of the JSON files of the recordings that we have from a group meeting. Then it asked me some details about it. What would you like? What's in the source? Are you interested in a blog post? Are you interested in a technical write-up? Are you interested in social media? Etc. I filled in those answers it gave me a cost estimate those who cost thirteen point six zero US dollars sorry zero point one three six zero dollars so thirteen point six cents is its estimate. Then it asks you a bunch more questions, gives you a, it goes back to the model and pulls it for a summary outline. And then based on the model's suggested outline, it asks me again, what would I like to keep from that it said so it's proposed an introduction a section on context a section on goals a section on technical discussions a section on conclusion and that's based on what it's read of the transcript and come back with and I can choose to keep the conclusions or swap it with something else re-ask it for a different response I accepted all of those those it then had a a second section and it is now still producing the completed uh idea tree completed no it should it's still working actually so it'll go back and forth i've had this sit down and do it because in the background this is i've had this sit down and do it because in the background this is doing what we had talked about where it is summarizing and then asking it to summarize the summary and then asking it to sections that we've produced so one for context one for goals one for metaverse standards produce so one for context one for goals one for metaverse standards now it has a section for metaverse standards one for interoperability one for virtual reality headsets one for conclusion and so it's going to connect those all together it's making multiple round trips to the language model in the background here we don't see it all we see is a progress bar which is somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 in and uh when it's done we should have a miniature file structure in this drive that I'm running the application which will very easily you can just like a github push it to a hosting provider like Verso so it is pre-packaged to run with the wheels on if you send it to a hosting provider. In the instructions, it's kind of pre-configured out of the box to work with Vercel as a hosting provider, which is very handy if that's what you want to get at the end of the day. Whereas for us, we would be more interested in something we can have on wordpress in our blog structure so that's uh that's something i'm still working on replacing either it's getting this is this thing's output to be more something we can copy paste into our blog structure or I don't know yeah finding a different tool awesome while you were speaking I recorded about three and a half minutes of the of your screen share okay we could run through that and get that polished up. But I'm wondering if we should maybe keep that for Tuesday's meeting. To something that we can put on. Sure. And it's easy to repeat. You know, this doesn't take a lot to do again if I needed to. And I can screen record it just as easy as you can. Probably looks better if you do it. But yeah, so we did it and like that's something that I think is also cool. I find those sort of things really interesting. It goes along with it and it is, it can be useful. Yeah, so I mean to pick up on what Humble Tim says, so we do a lot of this and then it seems like from Jim's experience as well, then it gets stuck. So I suppose getting a pipeline from this content that we've now generated out that we need to work on. Which I mean, we're doing well with the Tuesday meetings. You know, because like a weekly working meeting, I think, is the place to do that. And to me, that's also sort of my office hours period where that's at least some time like what Tim was mentioning in order to make sure. That's my work on OMI projects time, basically. In addition to, frankly, the Wednesday meeting. I'm not the one hosting it with you guys, so I can use that to actually jump on GitHub and type out submissions and things like that. Absolutely. That's exactly what it's there for. I'm hoping this thing's not stuck. Last time I thought it was stuck and it just needed a little... I left it and came back and I don't honestly know how long it took, but when I came back, it was finished. So I hope I haven't got to send you something. That's fine. I'm wondering what else do we want to do in this hackathon? How long do we want to stay here? We did, we did pick down to have a blog outline, but if we're going to wait for this thing and we don't know how long it's going to take, that's... Yeah, I can post it to the media group. I'll put it in a GitHub discussion piece as soon as it pops out. But basically, that's the whole... Ah, here we go. Look, there's something coming down. You can see it just and it's done. All right, we're done. So it finished that thing. Nice one. Just in time. I'm going to start it. Okay. Ah, this is, it's right up here. And this is basically what you did for the WebexR blog as well. The same procedure. Yes, correct. Absolutely right. Huh. I ran up into a, yeah, I got hit by something. Claude gave me a, you've asked too many questions, Claude. So this happens in a cloud. It's not something that happens on your local machine that it gives that error. Correct. And it's an API limit that I reach. So I had a limit of 50,000 tokens, and that was using 50,000 tokens. I don't know what the original input was, that's something I need to investigate, but it maybe would take 20,000 tokens and turn it into 50,000 tokens of back and forth, for instance so so I would have to wait anyway, I have to look at that again. Either decrease the amount that I'm sending in that initial request, or I've got to find a way to upgrade my token count in Anthropic, which I think is doable on that level. Is this a money issue? It can be, that's one reason why you can run into a wall on your tokens, but usually it's a rate limit. So they just do it to maintain their capacity. On OpenAI, for instance, they won't let you spend more than X number of tokens because they say they have too many demands on their service. So my rate limit is 50, 50 requests in a minute. And I've only made three requests. So I only have 47 requests left, which is fine. So I actually only made two requests, but I did hit the 50,000 token limit. That's where I have my zero. I used up all 50,000 tokens. token limit. That's where I have my zero. I used up all 50,000 tokens. And I guess one way to do this optimization from a human input is saying, you know, having giving a one, a one through of the audio and saying, okay, discard, you know, minutes, this to that and this to that. We only need. Yeah, that's, that is preparing your info is a big part of that for sure anyway anyway that's a that's a hackathon for you like like uh we were saying before there's not always a guaranteed uh outcome it's not the process not the destination soundsbaltim, do you want to read out what you posted in the channel? Not particularly. It's the unpopular keel of the boat. No, I think it's a very good point. That's why I asked. I definitely agree. So the experiment with AI curation is good, but you're not going to just hand over everything to AI and get a magic, magic result. So like we just said with Jimmy, preparing the questions, maybe limiting the minutes, you need to do a little bit of work. So AI is a tool that you can use, but you're not going to hand over everything and make it a magic result. You need to look at the alignment with the broader community. You need to look at the ongoing management. So what's the sustainability? Like you're saying, people can't burn out. We can't say all these things could happen and someone should do it because who ends up doing it? Yeah, and it's some of that inner work too that um like uh like recently the the plus and email addresses with msf was kind of mentioned as a problem but that was actually um a uh a hack around because multiple people wanted uh access to msf and I helped kind of bust that door open. But we also had kind of, there's never been like a treasure or easy way to spend any of the money coming in, right? So we could have purchased all these other Google accounts, right? But these weren't people agreeing to do anything. They just wanted to go listen to MSF, right? And so the plus hack allowed us to basically cheat and set up these aliases, which forward to individual people's emails, but are actually that singular admin account that we're paying for. So it didn't cost us more money. But it turns out downstream here a couple of years later, I guess, that that plus hack actually interfered with harvesting the data, for example. But that was a huge, huge battle that never got documented. And I'm not sure how that can fit into any. I also ended up being a sudden representative for synonymous participation in general with Kronos and the W3C. And there's this huge essay that the W3C came back with about how they might approach synonymous participation. And that also has nowhere to feed into this current proposed system, you know? Cause there weren't like really meetings about that. And like, there'll be no recordings about it. And anyway, that's where the inclusivity kind of thing comes from. Like if there's work that's taking place, but it's not sexy and it doesn't fit into kind of like the whole blog concept. How do we how do we place an inviting value and opportunity on that kind of work to not just stuff that can be ran through the machine into tweets, you know? Yeah, absolutely. So I think the human aspect there is important to to capture those. aspect there is important to capture those. It's interesting that you talk about this eudonymous aspect because I know back when OMF just started, that was also huge. It was trying to trade off the trust and the identity. I found it so interesting. I'd love to have a whole think tank about that in particular. If you talk about how to include that in this machine thing can you expand a bit more about that and then while we're talking maybe think in the back of your head and then we do a little sound clip about these issues as well like I did with Jimmy and Jin that we can also publish because that's what I want more of a spotlight on those things in IMI as well, you know, in terms of getting those broader audiences in. I get what I'm saying. Okay, so that was a very disjointed talking. All right, yeah. I don't know. I guess are we done with the main hackathon and the recording? Yeah, I think so. I think we've done what we can do. You know, we've shown, so in summary, we've shown two different approaches and we used his approach and that he summarized and then Jimmy used his approach which is called forgotten it again ah I've said all that again to make a nice sound Lumentus okay so what we did in this hackathon is we used two tools to explain or to summarize blog... fuck! I have to do it again. I'm too tired! Okay, one last try. What we did in today's hackathon is summarize community meeting audio files into blog posts. Jim used a tool that he summarized using Cloud. And then Jimmy used a tool called Lumentis to get a similar output. And so this is used as a tool to help the volunteers spend their time more efficiently to gather the wealth of knowledge that we share in OMI. Please join us on Discord. Okay, so that bit's done. Over to you, Humble Terminates. Actually, could I get a five-minute loo break? Can we maybe stop the recording then? Yeah, sure. Go more careful. I would like to get a little sound clip from you it doesn't have to be now um and if you don't want a sound clip we can do it in some other way is that what you're saying you'd like to contribute um in an inclusivity way in a way that is not audio recorded. Guys, I got to get going. So I appreciate it. It's good getting the session in and I'll try and get this in the can later. Thanks, Jimmy. And let's catch up on Tuesday and process some of this. Sounds good. One quick question, Jimmy. Yeah. Would budget from OMI to get more credits for the tokens or something, would that help remove any of the blockers in front of you? That was probably 50 cents worth of action that we went through there, maybe less. I'd have to go back and track it, but I'm happy to contribute it even in a tax-free environment, without worrying about writing that off in any way. All right. Cool. It sounds like it's more a server issue from their side. But if it is a money issue, then… When we get back to transcribing, it may be something that might come up again because there's a project, there's a system called Deep… Deepac… Anyway, Describe describe and it's uh uh anyway that one may have some once we use it a lot we'll run out of the free tier and it is probably the best diarization a transcriber out there and I would suggest that as a option going forward there and i would suggest that as a option going forward to get the json files excellent okay guys talk to you all later thank you okay give me um a couple of minutes um do break and then stop recording"}
