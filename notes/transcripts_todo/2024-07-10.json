Thank you."}], "text": " So here's the animated waterfall. And I can put play on the animated waterfall. And the water looks like it's flowing. And there's also some lights that fly around. Just for showing off the extension. But yeah, it looks really cool. I implemented this in Giddo Engine over the past two weeks. It's about how long it took to make this work for both import and export and also designing it to be extensible so that any user code in Github Engine can provide more mappings between animation pointers and Github properties. I cleaned it all up last night and submitted it as a pull request. I'll never understand why it always says video playback aborted due to network error. Surely it could work sometimes. Happens to me too. But I was just looking at that repo, the readme for animation pointer. And yeah, did you also edit in Godot as a implementation? Not yet, because the Godot implementation hasn't been merged yet. But I will surely submit a pull request to Kronos to add Godot to the known implementations for this. Actually, I should probably do that for a bunch of extensions, like the lights and a few others that Githo has supported for a long time. Oh, and also, I might have mentioned this already, but the Githo support for this extension is... I made it both import and export. So if you want to write some code or if you want to make an asset in Giddo Engine and you want to export that asset for use in other apps, you can do that. So you can use Giddo as a content creation tool. So you could also just use Giddo to make a GLTF that gets consumed by Giddo later. That's what I'm doing. using Godot to make GLTFs? Yeah. I got a question. Because Blender and GIMP and these other programs, when you do stuff, you can easily kind of see commands so that you can later script it. Does Godot have this kind of verbose output so you can kind of, is it possible to run headless? It is possible to run headless, yes. And I don't think there's as much of a I'm not sure how it compares in terms of its scripting API but you can at least do a script is it written in GDScript in the engine's own language that you can just call into that script on the command line. And you can also pass arguments on the command line as well. So if you want to be able to run it headlessly and use it as an automated tool, you can do that. I don't know if a lot of people do use it for that, though. Yeah, I haven't seen any examples. Anyway, it would be great if Blender supported this, but I don't know if Blender has implemented it, and I haven't tried. Not too familiar with Blender's animation system or in how to develop for Blender, and would love to see this and also a bunch of OMI extensions available in Blender. But I haven't bothered to do that yet. I've got so many other things to do. Speaking of other things to do, I also made this pull request to OMI GLTF extensions that's upgrading the schema version. So we'll be able to review that in tomorrow's meeting, although anybody's welcome to look at it and approve it in advance of that meeting. Speaking of schemas and tomorrow's meeting, yesterday I was at the open Canvas working group call where they're working on interrupt between Infinite Canvas tools, and they were talking about schemas and how to kind of handle different features and whatnot. And I introduced them all to GLTF extensions and how those work. And they clicked for some, and I invited them to check out OMI, drop some links in their chat. So maybe we'll see that, because there's a lot of parallels between GLTF ecosystem and what they're attempting to do. Yeah because JSON canvas is basically like the 2D version of GLTF, right? Pretty much. It even has a z-axis though, like what they're looking into for the spec. And there's a lot of different features, and it's like, how do we handle them all? And I'm like, you know, you could just have some that are optional as extensions. And showed them snippets with the needle viewer, in terms of gltf viewers needle tools has quietly kind of built one of the most future filled ones Anything else on the agenda? I just invited Meseekspot. I kind of dropped in here late. seek spot kind of dropped in here late. I'm going through MSF stuff right now and I could use some help. If anyone wants to earn like a little bounty for helping me out just to kind of value one's time and contributing, I'll share my screen and show you what I'm working on. It's really easy in terms of the task. It's just tedious a bit. The thing that I'm working on is I have a script and this script basically it goes through all of the videos and I'm using various Python libraries to detect faces extract frames and just kind of remove any frames that have faces detected or maybe like a solid color, meaning like someone's screen sharing and it's all black. Anyway, just kind of curate the most unique images out of each video recording. And out of these images, then I have these layouts that kind of follow a minimum number of images per each. And then it joins them together into posters. So this is kind of what the final output looks like for every single call. But the thing is, as you can see, it kind of misses some. So I'm going through and what all this, my script does, it just kind of automated a whole bunch of stuff that then it makes the kind of task easier to go and manually clean up. And I just see no way kind of like it's the 80, 20 rule, you know, it helped out 80% and we can just kind of finish the rest. And if it doesn't hit like four images, like I would delete all three of these images and then it's three left. It goes into a separate bin. So what I need help with is basically going through these folders, of which I have 300-something left, and then curating the images based on uniqueness, and if any email addresses or faces leak, to delete those until it hits one of these minimum numbers, and then move it into the ready pile. And if it's below four images, just kind of put it into a separate pile for redoing that later. And that way, the overall goal is to create those posters so that we can kind of see at a very high level all the various activities of MSF over the past year. So if anyone is down to help me out with that. I'll tip you. And it would really help out because I want to create something amazing to present at SIGGRAPH in a few weeks. And you get to get a look at all the stuff that's been happening at MSF. It's kind of a cool learning experience, what all the working groups are doing. Hint, it's a lot of Google Docs and slides. But the information in them is interesting. Also, if you kind of see repetitive slides, just imagine it as a poster. We don't really need this one, this one. We can just keep the finished one. You know what I'm saying? All right. Now that's 10 images. another one in the ready pile, bam. Oh, face deleted. Other than that, and just shout out in the chat if you want to help. Not expecting much, but I could give you a pile, like 20 of these. Or working groups, you can just focus on one individual group. Another thing I've been seeing around lately is SVG to 3D. Did someone unlock the secret to that? I've seen that done before. I'm not quite sure what's streamlined about it yet, but I'm trying to look for something that can streamline or automate the process of PNGs or SVGs to 3D. I know how to do all this manually. But I want to script it because I've got thousands of logos. So I got this plugin. I could try to script it with that. I mean, I would much rather pass it on to a junior dev. I thought there were libraries that could do that. No. I haven't really heard of any. There's like Blender tutorials but yeah not really sure if there's libraries per se but the overall goal for reference as well let me just it's on my other computer I forgot for reference as well. Let me just... Oh, it's on my other computer. I forgot. Yeah, basically I was just going to show a docu-source of all the MSF meetings. And now I'm just kind of in the visual part. So maybe I'll drop some screenshots later. But once I get all these pictures nicely organized, I'll put them into kind of posters. So we kind of have a section per each working group where they can show off all the you know a culmination of all their meetings and what they worked on um so i have a programmatic way of kind of creating that in blender but i want to trim all this fat i later can like create a hyperlapse video from frames taken every second or whatever for kind of an overall video summary. And I've already got some scripts cooking for that. But for the displays, I mean, these are all 4K images. And it would just be a huge waste with all this kind of showing the same. I mean, it is kind of a nice look at, okay, you know, obviously this meeting was mostly focused on documents. It's kind of interesting to see MSF from this high-level view, though. You know what I'm saying? Like, this is what the Metaverse Standards Forum groups have been working on for a while it's also kind of interesting there's a lot of higher detail in the MSF 3D Asset Intraoperability groups in their slides that's been a joy to look through it's the biggest most active group in the forum. There's just kind of a quality bar that's a bit higher in that one than what I've seen in some of the other ones. After I summarized all the transcripts, yeah after I summarized all the transcripts I'm thinking I've got some pipelines that I'm planning to implement with the slides so I want to also you know, there's Florence 2 from Microsoft which does really good segmentation, captioning. I think there's a demo somewhere. How do I use? I think it's here. Oh, it's just here. I was just here yeah the main goal is then just to add another section and the docs for kind of what the AI has seen in the slides and then that could supplement the rest of the notes for each meeting. And then later, also from Microsoft, they released something called GraphFrag, which is just a different way of doing extracting insights. And I'm really interested in finding a way to extract the actual graphs that it's able to create out of them, like knowledge graphs like this. This is kind of a cool way of aligning all these different things together. Because, I mean, the Open Canvas Working Group, the JSON canvas spec has a lot to do with edges and nodes. And I also saw this really cool Blender concept using geometry nodes, in which they're visualizing edges and nodes as these 3D objects. And I want to take some of these concepts and be able to export these knowledge graphs as 3D objects. It would be so cool as well to be able to export a Canvas save file as a 3D file. And so there's some snippets in code and could OCR this. They link to a notebook as well. I don't really like Jupyter notebooks. But I mean, these results are so cool. Especially when animated. If that can export as an animated GLTF, that would be so sick. So, yeah, I really want to explore ways of extracting insights from a huge body of data from an organization and build tools that are reusable for just generic, you know, apply to any kind of video or notes and be able to explore that, you know, in a human readable immersive form. So not just kind of like extracting into text, but extracting and processing into experiences and digital objects is part of the goal. Another way of doing such is kind of conference booths or displays, which those posters are easily importable into Blender via Image to Plane. It's a plugin that you can enable, and then you can just import even a whole bunch of images. So once you enable Import Images as Planes in Blender, So like once you enable import images as planes in Blender, all you have to do, go here, import posters. You can do a whole bunch at the same time. And then you've got some options over here. I believe I did Y up and don't need to use alpha at all. And you don't need to do any kind of blend mode emit. So it looks right. Ah, I forgot to set the DPI. Whoops. Okay, so definitely not Y up. The settings will stay the same. I think it was z up. And then... Plane dimensions, dots there. This way, it kind of... Well, they're all 496 aspect ratio anyway, so... Whoops. There we go. Associated metadata and indexing. associated metadata and indexing what is the comment about MTV for okay Z up I mean that's still kind of cool though like you could have like a stack of papers for that working group. And maybe you can make them pick up a little object or something, you know? Maybe you could kind of cascade them so you can create some kind of UI where maybe you pick out something you want later. I was going for more of a row. Did you ask about my comment? Yeah, I'm wondering what that's referring to. Yeah, I was just thinking, it's one document with lots of slides in it, right? So it would be cool if there was metadata included in that document that had an index so that you could have maybe keywords associated with different pages or chapters, all that. Right, right. Yeah, and I mean, I would like to inject metadata into kind of like exif for the posters. So you can get richer, sort of better search capabilities as well later on when going through these. And now, can this be stored in a GLTF file? Yes. Is that the intent? The intent is making GLTFs per working group. So if I take all the meeting posters for the 3D web group, right? And then side by side to the right. Yes, that sounds correct. That doesn't look So now this is in the order of earliest to latest. So this is kind of one of the first meetings. And as you're kind of walking down, you're seeing all the most recent meetings. Is this all in one VLTF? No, I could export it as such. Sure. this all in one VLTF? No, I could export it as such. Sure. I also, for some reason, I hard coded in the 496 ratio. It doesn't need to be. The output width and height could be dynamic based on how many slides there are. But I was going for various aspect ratios, like 16 by 9 or 10 or 4 by 3, et cetera. So it was a little bit tricky, though, thinking about if I ever wanted to go from these images. This could be basically a UV map for something else. Instead of a poster, what if they were all separated into something else? Maybe a booth? Maybe a spinning object with each slide kind of. Yeah, I like your idea of a 3D graph and figuring that out. I'd love to help you do that. Yeah. So I'll link that thread in Discord. And that has all the relevant info about doing such. No way, they linked the... What? Oh, now we're good. So this is new. Six hours ago. Node group network. Ah, got the code. And just to show, this could be a GLTF object. There's been geometry node export from Blender to GLTF since 4.0. Okay, that didn't work. It's probably a shader. Is there even a material? No. Just add one real quick. Oh, it should have one. I don't know, is this different than... Can I just apply, Make this a mesh? Maybe it's way too... There we go. And the data would come from node positions and edges. Yeah, so that stuff, really easy to extract from. The JSON canvas spec has this, as well as all sorts of mind map software has this. Nodes, edges. It's very standard for these types of things. I wonder if it's also kind of like what made it click for me and what made me introduce them to GLTF was one person entered the meeting yesterday to show off a project they're working on, which was very, very similar to what we were seeing with behavior graphs in the GLTF extension for interactivity. I'm like, wow. Like, what we're working on here is like, you're really similar to those conversations with behavior graphs. And it's like they're kind of working on introp for sort of for the nodes. And knowing that, it would be just a mistake to work on that without referencing what Chronos has already done. Because there's no reason to be desynced from that for no reason, when you could instead be synced with it. Yeah. So, like, I kind of gave them a rundown of, like, what is kind of minimal requirements, you know, having a standard reference viewer, having at least a couple of implementations, a spec, having a standard reference viewer, having at least a couple of implementations, a spec and kind of the template for an extension, as well as showing some examples of extensions. These meetings are all recorded, uploaded, summarized, and the notes also posted on OCWG on GitHub. So I'll link that in the chat for anyone interested. So here's like a recap. And what's cool about this group that I think MSF could, you know, take a page from is, you know, their dog fooding stuff in their meetings. Like they have their meeting on Zoom, sure. But also every meeting notes is on one of these infinite canvas tools. So I thought that was really great. I think this was yesterday's meeting. Yeah. Ah, I even took notes of my overview. So we should also maybe consider showing up there two weeks from now. And I'm sure vice versa, they'll show up at the GLTF extensions meeting because there's just a lot of overlap, especially in that context of interactivity and node graphs. Are they using any GLTF now? No. They're not 3D people. Maybe they are, actually. One person, Orion Reed, this guy, he's been making some interesting demos, like where is it? TLDraw is turning more into a programming environment. I thought this was really cool, by the way. I just want to show this off while I'm trying to look for the other thing. This is tldraw. But what he's doing is he's using accessibility APIs and simulating paste key presses. So just kind of like those accessibility APIs. It's kind of like OCR-type stuff and is able to have programs talk to each other where the metaverse is like the clipboard, gluing things together. And it kind of reminded me of this one post about script board screenshots as APIs. So I'll link this in the chat. Screenshots as a universal API. Combined with accessibility APIs, yeah, it could be a really powerful way of sending data between apps. Especially when you combine such with LLMs. Yeah, I can't really find a thing I was looking for, but I guess the short version is this can all be expressed with nodes and edges. And if we can turn this into a GLTF, that would be really cool. I'm not sure how to do text. I that would be really cool. Not sure how to do text. I was just thinking of screenshots. Because right now they export everything to PNGs. Good. If I were to export this, I could export it as SVG, PNG, or JSON. So if I wanted to export all these notes to JSON, what I get shapes, x and y, the text just kind of in there. And if you had an image file or something, it would put an SVG in the JSON, I'm assuming. Yeah, they were also debating how to do that. And they were talking about what if we could have Canvas Z, kind of like a bundled version, kind of like how we have GLB. kind of like a bundled version, kind of like how we have GLB. Because, I mean, between relative and direct links and base64 encoding images, which would really blow up a file, it would not be pretty to look at something with a ton of base 64 in there. But in terms of SVG, what's this even look like if you were to? It's beautiful. Wait a second. SVG. Does it work? Oh. It's not much of a... It's not much left. I thought it would work. Yeah, Blender has SVG import, but... I don't know, it didn't work. I would love to see a pipeline, though, between this and 3D files, so if anyone wants to hack on that, that would be awesome. Because I've got basically all the meeting notes for MSF as JSON. And I was thinking, you know, there could be a 2D way of overviewing all of that information versus a knowledge base. And then going from the Canvas spec into 3D files. I've got a script to kind of do that, but I don't know. It needs more work. Anyhow, anyone else have something they want to demo? MS Recall? Yes. MS Recall is probably doing that. Here, check out JSON Canvas. They have a whole bunch of libraries and apps shown here. And one thing I want to do is add a 3D engine to that list. Thank you."}
