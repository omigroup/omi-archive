We just, you know, we meet every Wednesday. Most of you, I think everyone here I know. But if this is your first time here and you want to introduce yourself, now's a good time to take maybe 30 seconds to say who you are and what brought you here today. All right, cool. And if you've been here before, which is everyone here, I think you're welcome to reintroduce yourself if you would like. I do want to give a quick re-intro that I'm representing Omi at the Metaverse Standards Forum for the Avatar wear wearables digital fashion wearables group there and so if anyone is interested in Intrappable wearables we have a bi-weekly meeting every Monday around 11 Eastern so one hour before now and we're currently just kind of And we're currently just kind of been working on a pipeline to summarize all of our past meetings and figure out ways that we can better onboard and catch people up as to our activities, which I feel is something that can be organization agnostic and the tools that we build for that digestion and dissemination of information can be applied to any org which we've been doing here in OMI as well so I've got a bunch of notes I can share later some screenshots in the chat I'll just drop some stuff I've been working on, such as here's all the posters from various slide presentations and meetings of all the calls that we had. I just dropped into the voice chat here. And I've got a repo with all the transcripts as well as summarized versions of those transcripts uploaded to GitHub. So I'm working on a way that we can take all of that data and figure out from very high level view, are we aligned in our mission, our goals? Anything that we're overlooking, what can we do to kind of improve, et cetera. Thank you, Jen. Thank you, Jen. Well, I guess let's go ahead and get started with the rest then. Before we move on to any potential agenda items, do we have any updates from our working groups? We can go ahead and start off with the GLTF subgroup if there is representation. Okay. And maybe the media group. Any updates from the media group? So Aaron's got a conflicting meeting. That's probably why he hasn't been yet. And I was wondering if we should move the meeting an hour later. And then Jimmy has been traveling. So I think he is here, but I think he's on text only. Cool. So there hasn't been updates on the media group this week. Okay, great. And then I'm trying to think if I'm missing any updates from MSF. I know Jen just literally just talked about that, but any other updates related to that? I think there's a written... On the 22nd. Okay. Yeah, on the 22nd, we have a call in terms of like this committee to review and they're kind of working on quad charts. And they are mostly interested in activities, objectives, deliverables, challenges. So I've been gathering all the Zoom recordings, all the transcripts from that, and the metadata, which kind of tells, like, how long someone's been on a call, who, etc., and then finding ways to present all of that information in a distilled way, bullet points, you know, into those four quads, activities, objectives, deliverables, challenges. But also, I want to show the review committee and just kind of talk at a high level with more visual information about how things are going and ways to improve, such as reducing friction between working groups. How can we kind of synergize better? Because right now there's just so many speed bumps to access the notes from another group. You have to go through so many hops and hoops through the portal. And, you know, we could gather those assets and run it through some pipelines and find ways to build in more digestible ways, like memory palaces type stuff, use cases, just kind of displaying it in an infinite canvas, whether 2D or 3D would go a long way for people to see what groups are working on. Like the screenshot I dropped in a chat, that's from PureRef. But there's this... If you know about Obsidian, Obsidian is an offline note-taking program for Markdown. But they released this open standard for infinite canvas format. Like what Miro or Figma, you know, those are infinite canvas apps. Obsidian has one called Obsidian Canvas, and it released JSON canvas as an open file format for canvases. And there's a spec and there's multiple implementations. So these people are working on sort of like what we want to work on for metaverses but in a 2d sense you know like this kind of introuble file format and also the obsidian dev is who came up with the file over app philosophy so i just really respect this team love the project I'm a huge HackMD fan but like HackMD and Obsidian can go hand in hand you can download all your notes in one zip file from HackMD import it into an Obsidian vault and have the best of both worlds but yeah I think JSON canvas should be something that should be more discussed in metaverse circles. In MSF, we use Google Docs a lot. And I just feel like there's an opportunity to dog food what we're about in the process, the tools that we're using, like Markdown, you know, like for all about metaverse interoperability, why don't we start with, you know, the document sharing type programs and files that we're using to share notes. That's kind of how the internet started. It's like a way for researchers to collaborate with one another easier. So maybe we can apply similar thinking for working groups. Yeah, definitely. Anything that we can do to reduce the friction between those working groups and improve the knowledge dissemination, I think would be really excellent. It is a little bit opaque trying to glean knowledge from a lot of those Google Docs, trying to glean knowledge from a lot of those Google Docs, especially the way that MSF Docs seem to be written. Very kind of, you know, obtuse, standardized, templated kinds of things, which are not always the most useful at a glance. So yeah, if there's ways that we can help to improve that as we're working on it, that'd be awesome. Yeah, kind of related as another MSF update, I've been following along with the Avatar Interoperability Working Group. They're another bi-weekly Monday meeting, chaired by one of the folks who's on the VRM consortium. So I think there's a small but passionate group of people kind of working on that. So I volunteered to help out with some of the use case documentation for those guys. and yeah I think you know some of the stuff you're proposing if I can help spearhead some of that with some of these other working groups definitely happy to help yeah there's you know obviously a lot of alignment between wearables and avatar group and that's one of the other groups that I kind of like prioritized in one of the other groups that I kind of prioritized in terms of the summarization pipeline. So I have already on a GitHub repo summaries of every single meeting from the avatar characters group as well as the wearables group. And I can share the link in the chat. Beauty. All right. Well, thanks for the update. Well, then let's go ahead and move on to demos. Because I'd love to see some. I see Stu's here, but I don't mean to put you on the spot, but does anybody have a demo that they want to showcase for the group? What have you been working on? Ah, fun question. Well, I guess I can show you. Can you help out with this AI pipeline stuff? Yeah, probably. Let's see. Last week I spoke at an event, and I think I missed our meeting entirely, but it was because I was in D.C. And we had a booth at this D.C. AI Expo for National Competitiveness. I spoke on a panel, and what was really cool is for two days, we had a line at my booth of people that wanted to chat and learn more about what we do at Virgin. Most of the other booths there were for some product. Uh, and I definitely, you know, my background is product. So, um, it was interesting because there weren't really very many other service providers there. Um, one of my main goals in the last like few months is to get past performances that's what matters when you start any company especially in the services space and uh so i have two builds that are happening uh one we just finished that i'll try to pull up the demo um it's a financial analyst agent and you can essentially the reason why it's profound is profound ish um is that you can chat with it through an open source front end i've been using something called chain lit so i'll share my screen um chain let's really cool if you haven't heard of it it's like a chain there it is um it's like an open source front end that like has this really useful cookbook if you code in python it's it's going to be like really useful for you as well because it's just runs really well with uh python backends um so we use chainlit for a front end and basically you can talk to it and upload financial data. The first client is a company that performs helping you raise money and helping you determine what your valuation should be and what your potential valuation would be. So they work in that space. And you can't afford to have AI hallucinate. Right. Something interesting about, I think, about chat GPT, about the creative GPT is that GPTs are super powerful. Like you could like I could upload some financial data. Let me see if I can find some dummy financial data here. You know, I could actually I think it has some uploaded. So the important thing is like, they want to be able to upload financial data and be able to ask it to perform certain calculations, run simulations, like Monte Carlo simulations. But the point is, they want to be able to say, like, what if we increase prices across our 10 product lines by 5% year over year for the next five years? What would our potential valuation look like in good conditions, okay conditions, and bad market conditions? These are the types of things that financial advisors, they're not financial advisors, but these folks who have these certifications that do this high-level consulting, this is basic stuff for them. We call it the junior financial analyst agent. And the thing that's cool about ours is the calculations are done manually with Python on the backend. So there's lower risk of error. We don't have to worry about the agent making up numbers. A scary thing about using something like a GPT, which you can see here, you know, this thing's pretty great. It's working through its reasoning. It's coming up with how it's going to do the calculations. It's telling me it's work like this is great. But I don't know if the numbers it comes up with are accurate. And so we do want to always double check and fact check. So this is a really useful, quick GPT that I spun up. The tool that we made uses Chainlit on the front end, has Python on the back end. You can put any model in the middle. And when it runs the calculations, it's doing so manually and then feeding the response back. It was inspired by Google. I went to a Google Gemini talk here in DC. And let me see google agent builder and i think it was called like a calc calc tag financial data hopefully this comes up with it either way they showed me this like cookbook um hack that they do that basically you wrap the calculations that you need in something like a calc tag. And then you tell the agent in the prompt, whenever you need to run a calculation, pull out your calculator, right? A.K.A. send the data that you need out to this program that's going to do the math. And then it'll feed it back and then take that response and respond with that response. the math and then it'll feed it back and then take that response and respond with that response. So you can conversationally ask this agent to, hey, actually, those numbers are great. Now increase it by another 5%. Or can you create a chart for me? Can you output that? And you know that the math is sound. We're still obviously advising that this customer double check the math because it's risky when you're dealing with the company's financial data. Um, but it's able to run, you know, locally. And, uh, I think that's pretty cool. So, um, the second one that we're making right now is for a friend who is a developer. Um, but he, he's also a DJ and he specifically likes manually mixing music. Like, he likes that. So I asked him, like, you know, do you want AI to help generate playlists for you? And he said no. But what he wants is to be able to send it a message at any time during the day. And it'll go and find the song through his subscriptions to different what's called DJ pools and download that song for him. to different what's called dj pools um and download that song for him it'll then pass it in through python and do what's called stem separation so there's tools like la la la la dot ai which you can upload a song and it does stem separation it gives you the vocals the drums the guitar um well one of my guys is uh he has like a way of doing it with python maybe he found a package i'm not sure but he like a way of doing it with Python. Maybe he found a package. I'm not sure, but he was excited to just do it with raw code. So this agent will be able to take commands any time of day, download music, perform stem separation, and then put all those stem tracks into an S3 bucket. So when he gets home or wherever he's at with his decks, he can transfer those songs onto his decks and do some mixing. It's not obviously scalable or like some enterprise great thing but it's so fun and it's been a really fun build and we should have a demo for that in about uh four weeks reliably that we can show off um everything else is more commercial like uh we're exploring with this real estate company to do like a real estate investor agent. Um, most of the work still in discovery phase. And what I've been finding as like a founder is that a lot of folks know that they might need AI, but they don't know where to begin. And there's so many tools launching every day that like, of course I love that, but it can be overwhelming. Um, so just most of my conversations right now, to be transparent as a founder, I really like consultations and helping advise folks, getting discovery sessions and design sprints and all that stuff set up so that we can help them pinpoint where it's even appropriate, if it's even appropriate to apply AI. And just trying not to be like snake oil salesmen. That's very, my relationships are really important to me. So I'm trying to manage expectations. I really like your focus on keeping the sort of human oversight and accountability there. Like, you know, the phrase that you said, it's really important for ai not to hallucinate um because i've been really irritated by that and the amount of like drivel that they split up um so i really like your approach there um and i think it's a really valuable service that you're giving to consult on that and i was thinking we need to write a blog post about that because I think it's probably a good piece of advice to send out into the wider world as well. Yeah, I'd love to. And maybe we, you know, make it like pepper in some really good metaverse interop stuff in there. Like so OMI has a draft protocol called OMI personality. I think everyone here probably knows about it, but I was really excited about it. It was drafted, I think, a year ago. And it's meant to allow you to inject a personality through, I guess, maybe a single prompt, I don't remember, but I believe through like an API or some type of subscription service. So you could use a tool. What would be really great about this, if you can make it more extensible, again, I'm not sure the status, is that if you do use a tool like Magic, right, which obviously I love, or if you use Langchain, or if you use anything, it'd be really great if you can feed the output of that AI agent or AI tool into your VRM avatar. What this unlocks is like people who, I mean, agents who can, what we call embodied agents who can work the desk of your VR, I mean, of your Metaverse hotel. Or when you come to the OMI group website, there is a embodied agent right there that you can ask questions about OMI protocols. But being able to, using some other tool elsewhere, tweak, upload knowledge docs, whatever tool you want to use, right? I think that's what's important. And being able to make those changes, kind of like Westworld or, you know, any of those cool, cool movies and shows that have come out. O my personality is like profound in my opinion um because of the potential and i think it would probably be appropriate to incorporate uh i just went on a really long rant thanks guys has anybody used OMI personality? I haven't used it yet, but I've started digging into some of the docs that are on the GLTF extensions GitHub already. It's probably the extension I'm currently the most interested in. Cool. That's exciting. Jimmy asked, it's an awesome presentation. What was the front end tool for that demo called? Chainlet. And actually, I also forgot to show you the agent working. So but yeah, Chainlet, I'll drop a link right now in chat. And the Chainlet cookbook is fantastic it's a um you know it just you guys know what a cookbook is but for the purposes of the recording it basically there's a bunch of templates and frameworks that you can use everything from if you wanted to create your own white label interface that looks exactly like talking to chat GPT to, you know, powering applications, containerizing things, performing tasks, I believe, like rudimentary ABAGI template and just things like that. So I like it. It was introduced to me by one of my friends who's based in Columbia. And and i said hey let's try it and so far we're pretty happy um there's there's others i mean goodness uh lang smith is another one people are probably more familiar with um but i've been having fun learning this too i'll drop it in chat. Let me see if I can find that demo real quick. Let's see. Here it is. All right, cool. Now I need to find the dummy data and uh yeah here it is all right oh i guess i've talked a lot though does anybody else have a agent that they or i mean an agent anyone else have a demo that they want to show off oh you're not sharing your screen mr metaverse if you were hoping to cool thanks that's good to know um let's do this all right um so this one here again it's basic. They just wanted like a baseline that we can iterate on. But this has a specific skill set tailored at calculating what's called net present value and running Monte Carlo simulations. So hopefully it works. That would be hilarious if it doesn't. But calculate NPV. And it'll take a look. And so right now it's telling me what it's going to need. And it just performed the calculation right away. So it's super fast. If I were to ask it to help me with code, that should not work right like uh this is a risky demo shouldn't work should not work uh and ah dang okay cool so that stinks i'll have to fix that but it's not supposed to do code for us um but the whole point of this thing and deploying this thing um and i could have a old old link here but the whole point of this thing and deploying this thing, and I could have an old link here, but the whole point of this is if I go to your website and you have a chatbot on your website, right? Like we don't want, you don't, if the chatbot's answering questions about your product or your company, that's useful. But if somebody's like trying to hack it, you know, just be funny, jailbreak it, or they're, they're asking questions like help me out with this code. You know, it's just it's a waste. It's not the purpose of it, it kind of makes a mockery of the purpose of the agent that you have. And they're technically, you know, spending some of your, your compute on things that aren't relevant. So that's part of why we do things this way. I'm not sure if it actually knows that I updated, but great calculations. How about a Monte Carlo? Hey, Mr. Metaverse, this is Keyframes."}
