How about you just find one person you identify and make it for that person. And if you can just tell us that person liked it, that's good enough, maybe? Uh, what? Like, you're like, I can't tell. But I'm not interested in Blender add-on development and only extensions for its own sake, right? Yeah, that's why I said you have to at least have one person needing to use it. I did that. I worked on the Blender add-on. Then, for example, you were satisfied with it. And we merged it. I don't think it was a daily tool in the sense like someone using the same version of this, but for most of the hubs would treat it as a daily tool. So it matters who we're designing it for when we take assessment of whether we've designed it in a way that helps, right? Yeah, but there's a low bar and a high bar, and as many bars as you want to climb up. One particular scenario in my mind works as the handle for kind of a lot of, I guess, where my mind goes with the Blender add-on and extension. And that's the boombox at full volume that is unwittingly suddenly imported into a system, but it hurts people's ears. So the logical thing to do is, oh, hey, who has access rights? Can anyone edit this world? So then they trace it down to the boombox. And then what do they do? I think the option of having to destroy the boombox, like luggage left at an airport, okay, that works to solve the ear attack problem, right? But what do you do with that boombox now? And as it turns out, this isn't really part of the game plan that's been thought through yet on the GLTF extension front, or it's not meant to go here. It's not meant to go to this idea of opening it back up, changing the volume, and putting it back with just that amount of change, right? Well, the thing is, it's somewhat counter to many of the other formats. Like, one of the workflows that Blender likes is that it gets completely converted to the Blender format. And once it's completely converted to the Blender format, you can cut it apart and do surgery on it. So Godot seems the same way, right? We're talking about GLTFs with GLTF extensions, right? And then potentially maintaining and editing those assets as the only available source material that you have. I noticed that most places do not directly operate on GOTF. They tend to convert to internal for it. And this includes the official GOTF importer, exporter from Blender. Right, right. So it begs the question, what can we imagine as a workflow or a set of workflows, right? Because if it's essentially like compiling a binary application when you make this kind of GLTF, then you could pick up those kind of dynamics, right? Like treat it like minified JavaScript more than like, you know, open asset kind of thinking. Or you can think of it an animation of like a DOM where you can like size it to zero if it fails us in some way. Like average importer workflows where you animate the property so it has no volume, for example, or no noise. Over in the Hubs Discord, I don't know if anyone's in there, but... You're talking about a blender, right? Not on the engine side? Or are you talking about the engine side? How about Tim is talking about execution? Like, I'm in a virtual world, and this was a QTF. I'm in a virtual world and this was a QTF. So in my end, I'm going to put a ceiling on it, like a limiter, where you just can't go higher than breaking volume. That's not the only thing that is like this. There's also very bright flashing lights, for example. It's also very personal. Push those back? If a value is higher than then don't do like well it's like the difference it's like if you can have a sign you can report a sign so it's like zero to a million lights after this discord is probably the most one of the most experienced players in this space right and they limit we still have audio problems we still have audio problems with people coming in, clipping and stuff. And user-generated content spaces in particular, right? Yeah, I do worry about this. It keeps me up at night for sure. And, you know, it may not be obvious either, right? Like, oh, only audio. Let me implement that as a editor engine or something, right? Then users come along and start actually doing things with it. And that's kind of the first moment maybe where this like volume issue springs into existence. And that's where the luggage destruction comes in, right? Because if you're a platform trying to do anything like virtual world metaverse like, right your plate is full you know your plate is really full so yeah users start griefing each other you're going to empower the users to eradicate that problem as a knee-jerk reaction unless you have time to really stop and consider it right so then it kind of defeats the purpose. I've noticed that in certain popular social work platforms, they have immediate safety levels and very fast block and mute and ban options. Very effective, I mean. Well, that's the thing, though. How do you actually measure the effectiveness of something that eradicates something, you know? Which way? Well, if I need to destroy all audio things because nobody considers my ears, and I mute everything basically, and then are we still having a shared experience, right? You and I, if we're in a virtual world? experience, right? You and I, if we're in a virtual world? If one of the things... If you're talking to a deaf person, are you sharing a virtual world with them? I don't understand the relevance of that example. I'm talking about a situation where you have two human beings capable of hearing, right? And for whatever reason, there's content that's overwhelming one of their ears. So they basically turn off that content, right? They disable it from the audible perceptive space. So now in this situation, right, what are we actually looking at, right? One person went temporary deaf and can't hear anything. Yeah. So they're still in the same space. But if this is a video that's supposed to be part of the shared discussion space, right? Well, one of them now better have access to closed captioning or they're definitely going to miss out, right? Yeah, or they just, it's a live presentation and there is no closed captioning unless there's extra work to do. And it might not be possible to have an interpreter or an AI interpreter to translate or transcribe for you? It seems like you have to reach a certain maturity level as a thing that user-generated content can be made in, right? And where people can find and kind of reach critical mass traverse before some of these like social digital content generation nuances kind of organically present themselves. So I don't know. Maybe it's not as relevant to worry about it up front. To be clear, we don't have that. Let me try this again. We are not the best judge of this because not many of us here have a fully functional social metaverse online I don't know what best judge of it would mean I mean there's places where this is already happening right and then there's places being imagined where it could happen you know so I mean it's basically I'm saying And then there's places being imagined where it could happen. You know? So, I mean, it's. Basically I'm saying, I don't know. Problem to solve. Like the way I go through it is, is if we have a problem to solve, that means people are using the spec and it works. And we got, well, how about Tim is like thinking one step beyond about the consequences of us making only audio, for example, and causes someone's ears to hurt after someone's poop box is too loud in their imported world? It's a multivariable phenomenon. Like, if we call it a platform, right, on this other side of the equation, there are complex, potentially cascading decisions about how they approach user-generated content, how they view assets in general, which extensibility features they look to at all or first or exclude. I don't mean to cut in, but if the only audio has a whole lot of considerations, maybe there's lower hanging fruit? Just for the sake of... Historically, we picked audio because it was the lower hanging fruit that we thought was possible. Originally, I don't know. I think everyone here was there at the beginning. But originally, it was actually like a token thing that there wasn't even supposed to be a spec necessarily emerged, it was a practice thing. But then it kind of cut its own teeth, right and turned into a thing. So, but I'm only bringing it up because the Blender opportunity comes up, right? But then what does that actually mean? Does it mean making essentially an audio, is it basically making an IDE that bundles OMI and PowerGLTFs, right? And then we could ask the question, okay, well, there's others making extensions that have to work with Blender. Does this mean we might want to be talking to sibling add-ons, essentially, and jiving interoperability that way, so that a user could have something for only audio, have something that does light maps, has these different things all at once in Blender, because there'll be some potential conflicts they're not coordinated, right? But then, if we're actually thinking about end-to-end kind of serviceability, where it's not just meant to empower the creator to bundle things, but the actual user to potentially, in an open source kind of sense, pick apart and refactor and remix and kitbash and stuff. Well, then maybe we're talking about some outside-the-box kind of thing where, yeah, GLf isn't quite meant as a source format but you know uh you know that's how you can force it you can force it yeah it's like people taking older games and forcing it into like a newer platform and they don't have the original code they don't have the original uh, they don't have the original artwork, they might not even have the original skeleton for the artwork, but they still want to be in the new platform using it. There's also a lot more legacy concerns about who made it and how can we pay them, but I'm just giving a taste. I don't consider the what? I think these specs have a very long life ahead of them just because I've seen kind of a glimmer of this in the building on VisionOS because the reality kit, you know, you can't import a GLTF, but there's a good library out there that is one by one adopting all of the GLTF extensions. And they're doing the custom implementation of like, what does this file look like in RealityKit? And it's one-to-one matching. It looks a lot better because, you know, it's native and the edges look great. But they're aiming to reach parity with the render so that you know gltf is compatible with it and you can have usdz files in the same room as gltf files and render them the same so i think that it's going to happen and and as long as people are creating content then there's a need to make that content work and that's what we got to drive i think second like simple many glpf support i don't know if that's known or not right any GLTF support. I don't know if that's known or not. Cool. Are they the last remaining metaverse who does not have GLTF? More like one of the first emergent metaverses who has survived all of the storms that have somehow denominated others off the map. But it's a nano community to be certain. How about earlier you said that, are you handing out a-up sheet to adopt a gltf extension or a blender what are you talking about earlier you're like what's a dot uh extension for blender adopt oh you mean um who in the wild would consider um integrating uh consider integrating OMI extensions into their GLTF workflow or import or user-generated content thing? Fire is referring to the potential for work packages to pace somebody to integrate the GLTF extensions in more apps, whether it be Blender or Unity or Unreal or something. Yeah. And you don't really need a sign-up sheet for that. You just need to get people to decide to do it, I guess. I mean, is there a... I guess iFire, if you're volunteering to be kind of like outreach evangelist and kind of mentor whomever might be imagined to pick up some of these things that I could see that working you've done that before right a little but like about here that's why I've, like, we've got a virtual site. See, who wants to adopt a geotab extension in there? I think you're kind of putting the cart before the horse there a little bit. Or the horse before the cart. I set up a couple of bounties or tasks on Dwork. If we want to go that way. But it's a multiple submission type thing. So just kind of set it to up to three submissions per task. Kind of always add more. And later, if we want to... You leave a message saying, I'm if you want two more okay all right so you've got the D work up to raise awareness and basically like dropping a couple a couple fish hooks in the water right see if anyone bites then I fire you're receptive to the idea of mentoring any takers right who might have questions about OMI extensions and might need advice on integrating it. Yeah, and let me know if they're looking for me, I guess. I don't know where the phishing is. What would be the goal of this project? Like, would it be to get the pools to actually officially adopt these, or would it be like a third-party add-on? I get the impression like a summer code kind of thing, you know? Like, to practice integration, maybe, and have a little fun, and receive some mentorship, I guess, as a learner, maybe. I don't know. I'm not sure who would go after this or be able to. Like, the people who do this professionally, they have their own toolmakers that would make this for them, for the artist, under their own care, and use this without revealing their're feeling this secret game project Sir list of mouth Sort of thing so it's like if you know someone You can even be one of us. It's like Just kind of looking to to add some implementations, you know, like a blender importer exporter for some of these extensions and for there to be a little bit of bounty money for, you know, to kind of value someone's time to work on that implementation. on that implementation. Well, could we, AMP PB, you've been working on stuff. And isn't that thing on the only home page? Is that using stuff that you did? Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's my app. I'm really close to a big release, and part of it's going to have the audio emitter support. As soon as I figure out how to calculate an elbow with an avatar, I can move on to that stuff. Maybe that could be kind of a practice thing. I have, like, so with the, I'm not sure if you were hearing in the demo that I did of the asset uploader that I'm building, but that's essentially what I'm going to use for for extension authoring like content um and i will make like an open source version that you can just like run on localhost that will allow you to put a gltf file in there add extensions and where it makes sense have some kind of like visual editor to position the extension if it has positional data and then on the sidebar have all of the parameters that you can edit uh it's a bit of a lofty goal but also it i keep thinking that it's the the smallest barrier to entry for adopting these because if you think about it like a lot of people export a gltf file from blender and then go to some web page like gltf report or whatever and drop it in there to see if it's valid and whatever so the same could exist for putting a file somewhere and saying i want audio and maybe maybe something for visualizing xmp better yeah xmp's got a lot of opportunity there i think gltf report does okay with like just displaying it but you have to go hunt for it. And when you see it, it's like, what does this data mean? And it's just raw text, you know. That's why I think that we should have any XMP implementation have, like, the copyright stuff built in, like what I did for Giddo. Yeah, I'm gonna do that for, I'm gonna have templates on my end for the XMP stuff. Wait, what? I lost the thread. How my end for the XMP stuff. Wait, what? I lost the thread. How did that get to XMPP? Not XMPP, but XMP, the metadata extension. I think we're using it as an example of what would this editor kind of flow or this content creation flow. Because the XMP extension is is not visual it doesn't have any real function aside from adding metadata to the to the file so like what would that editing flow look like obviously it's just going to be like a component you add to some hierarchy and then you get a sidebar to edit the parameters of it or add more or whatever but and we were saying how how templates are very important for that because when you create that content, you're kind of given a blank piece of paper and told write something that meets the specification, and that's not good enough. So got to handhold. Something that is readme.txt in a specific format right in the DLTF in the JSON. I think of it like exif and images, same kind of concept and purpose, maybe. I want to argue that it actually is the evolution of EXIF, as in it's an exact descendant of it. Yeah, very similar but more robust. Like a literal. You're saying EXIFs including? Like a little of this added up exif, yeah. Is it somewhere source maps could go? I've thought about doing like, yeah, I've thought about doing something like that, where like LOD definitions to where it can point to a part of the file where like the small screen version is there, and then you can maybe do some kind of partial download of just that piece? There's an argument that metadata can be deleted and nothing will break. Oh, that's interesting. For sure, Snaps, I was thinking, you have this glTF. It's a boombox. It has volume, right? And well, if it came from Blender, it came from an only Blender add-on stuff, then maybe even if the whole Blender file isn't included or anything, right, maybe there's an organic backtrack source map-like thing where anyone who discovers a moment where they need to work with that, especially if it's open source CZ0 or something, that they could actually recover or jump into that Blender file without a bunch of work, you know, because it's embedded into the debug and film basically like it would be in like a minified javascript you know that makes sense which happens to bypass the whole problem with the import too because uh um so so this is kind of where like a component system makes sense for gltf extensions where where it's like uh if i have an audio component um maybe you attach inside of that component a model component or something like and you start building these this like structure that's almost like the scene graph of uh of hubs like how the spoke files would save very similar to how the spoke files would save i think and then you have those those kind of grouped components represent different scenarios of like maybe it's an audio with a boom box so it's a model uh maybe it's a skybox and that skybox has global audio on it or something like that like i think it would and people can make like different remixes of these and i feel like like... I think that's what's missing. It's like content creation is hard, but if people make a bunch of remixable components that use these things, then it's very easy. But in Blender, we could do very similar, I think, even. I am not sure how to solve that. You go through Blender, and by default, it destroys all the extensions problem. Yeah, but that's what blenders just want to go through Godot, same thing happens. So I was thinking maybe like something like PB's tool where you interrogate the GLTF and put it back together as GLTF. Without taking too much off. Yeah, get draft for GLTF. I'm taking too much off. Get your F for GLTF. Well, and something that I'm doing too is I'm not actually taking it apart and putting it back together. I'm loading the file, giving people the options to edit it, and then taking all of those edits and applying it to the file, the source file in GLTF Transform. So I'm not building a scene and having people build it out. I'm making them define like I will add X extension, that extension will reference whatever node and then pressing that file out as a saved glTF. Um, so yeah Does that make sense? Yep. I feel like it's the least destructive way is to have a shadow, almost like a shadow DOM that you're working on and then save. I guess this would be controversial, but if there was a website where you could drop a GLTF and then it used some sort of curated table, it basically showed everything you'll lose if you edit it with a particular software version. Like if you use this with Blender and you don't have any add-ons, you're going to lose all this in context of your actual GLTF. That might help people actually locate the tools they need to actually work with the GLTF, as well as make an educated decision as to whether it's in their interest to round-trip it through Blender to fix something. How about, Tim, let's not make it negative, but what's this take on it? Instead of saying what's this take on it? Instead of saying what's broken, you'll lose, say what can open this GOTF? But the answer is going to be nothing a lot of the times. You can invent a situation using different extensions innocently. I know, but it's supposed to be positive so instead of what will break, you're saying what will open this. Well, I said it would be controversial to point out this fundamental flaw in the design of GeoTip when taken in this direction, right? But the truth is that it's going to affect people. People are already affected by it. It's already a thing. You say on the in, right? Like a file goes in, it removes extensions, and it comes out different than it came in. Yeah, so it's already a thing and i'm saying the in right on the input like a file goes in it removes extensions and it comes out different than it came in yeah so it's like it's like who can who can i you know the web browser thing where what can i use it's the same idea in in i actually hit this problem already in the in the editor that i basic one that i built uh if if you try to if you put a a VRM file onto the scene and you say, I want to compress textures because I don't have support for compressing textures in a VRM file and pushing it back out to a VRM file, I have a notice when they turn that on and the VRM is the source file, it tells them this is going to convert your file to a GLB, which will, you know, break the avatar functionality of this file. be aware before you do it um it's a pain I don't like that when you put a file in it can come out without stuff that's been probably my biggest gripe with transform but what else is there is it possible to do a different like is it is the is it actually possible to do a div at that point so dlc ltf transform has a report function that will give you a report of all extensions in it and then afterwards you can do another report and then compare the div well it's my ink going through? Sorry. It's not. Sorry. I want a force-directed graph version of the GLTF with extensions, right? Then you can actually, in VR, grab one of the little extensions and try to yank it out, right? And it resists, right? Because it's all entangled, right? But then... Like the Neo's representation of an avatar where it's all made of smaller components, right? Visually, in 3D space. Yeah, sure. That could work. Like, I mean, the idea just is that extensions, they're really stubborn if you think about it in terms of mobility, right? They're stubborn. Yeah, you have to do a lot of work to maintain them on the processing. But I do plan to... So part of the... Once we get extensions that are that are like very solid like right now audio i'm comfortable doing this and i've already done most of the work to do this um but i'm gonna just make the custom because because gltf transform has the ability to extend it with your own custom extensions so i'm just going to write those out for all of these and and we'll have those over time and then we can leverage transform and whatever we want um and and process them with that um it uses the inline so we could have running on a server too um i've got the wasm module so we can build a bunch of like playbooks in there that that process it in the browser um do you think it's possible to write extensions similarly even on behalf of other things like to make some sort of vrm component that i'm allowed i've started that but if you look at vrm spec it's it's so there's so many sub specs within it as extensions on extensions so i i went down that path of trying to write one write an extension for each one and have them interdependent but it's it's just when you get two levels deep into an extension that it becomes like what at what point am i defining that one that could be i want to say that the toon shading one is relatively separate from that three or four that are about humanoid skeleton breaking. Oh, interesting. Okay. Well, there's humanoid and then there's the spring bone. Yeah, yeah, they're all together. They're all mixed together because they require the name of the bone to be humanoid. Ah, gotcha. So genotype extensions are like DLL dependencies. In a way. I'm not sure I understand the comparison. Well, if you have an executable and it calls, it has dependencies like on some kernel 32 calls and it links to kernel 32, right? And you could propose, you could propose eliminating that and using some alternative like MinGW stuff. But it's not a simple proposition. It's often entangled deeply, right? And you end up with DLL hell when you don't have the DLL or you need the DLL or you got the wrong version of the DLL. So GeoTF, two cores like Windows NT, and we've been chucking extension at it for a few years now. So it's been extended a bit. Yeah, I get what you're saying there. Yeah, it is pretty... And it's fragile because it's like, oh, do I have the right version of this file? And I hit that also with DLLs. Like, do I have the right one that works with this build of Unity or whatever it is? And it definitely seems that there's lessons learned from the DLL stuff that might apply here then. one that works with this build of Unity or whatever it is. It definitely seems that there's lessons learned from the DLL stuff that might apply here then. It's obviously not ideal, but if it is the challenge, then there might be ways to... It solves a really big problem, so I don't know if it's something that you would want to engineer off of. What do you mean? It's a different problem i feel like because well i don't know i don't know man i'm thinking back about my own dll experiences where my actual ones recently and i don't know it's like oh you don't have the open vr dll for the stupid firestorm vr build right because i forgot to make sure that they'd be including that's the part where i'm struggling um well, okay, okay, okay. But the DLL, for the OpenVR DLL that ships with an app, right? It is necessary in order to harness the actual Steam installation that's local, right? So here, the JSON that binds to the GLTF extension, right? It's going to end up being the importer or app or whatever that ultimately does that, but its support for that, it's going to live separately, basically, than the GLTF. Like, the GLTF just has configuration, right? It's up to the app. It contains the binary brains of actually doing something with that extension. It happens to be in practice that everyone's kind of stepping into an executable. But in effect, you have different comprehensions across different apps. You might have different versions of DLLs. And so managing that chaos probably fits in a similar shape. This is by design, though. It's the stated goal that GLTF not have implementation-specific opinions, right? So I agree with you, though, it does create fragmentation in the actual rendering and usage of these files, but it does make them way more useful. Well, that's why I think a tool that could speak factually to the probabilities of something already would make it positive forever. Basically, here's where you can use this thing, right, without hassles. I'm going to think on that because I think you're right. And I think it's a good idea. I want to like actually try and implement something that does that in my uploader. I want to see what it means to be a little bit more verbose in what is happening to a file as it's coming in and going out. Maybe even saving those reports to their asset metadata. That would be cool. So note to that, if we have a tool that tells you which extensions are supported in which programs, and if your file is going to work in these various programs with all the features that are in the file, that's great. But also, we should really just work on more implementations so we can expand that list when it does exist. it does exist because imagine we make this list that says like where khr audio emitter will work and it's just like an empty empty list or just no engine that's it and then that's a really unfortunate list well i don't know like your file works in like it comes up with like a venn diagram of all the extensions in your file and the places that support all of the extensions and just comes up with with nothing as the result. How is that bad though? This is the beginning. This is the beginning and that's the truth that people are up against. It is the truth that has to be considered, right? And some geotablethers are more popular than others and that will have a lot of support like the VRM has a lot of support and by listing it, we will actually see, we can encourage people to use VRMs. And any degree of support, I think, would show up in the graph. There's that one project. It's an editor, VLTF something or other. But anyway, they just implemented OMI Audio on their own. And we found it one day. But like that would be linked to. Right. Because all it would take is doing doing a quick test to see that there's minimal support. Right. And then it would at least have presence in that Venn diagram. Right. And I think the presence view like the is there any kind of support at all? Right. That would kind of be the optimistic view, right? Of the forward facing kind of thing. And then the cold hard fact view, right? Would be that your work's cut out with you in certain trajectories here, because it is cut out for you. Like literally there's no evidence that that feature can work with that platform. So someone could go test it again. But ultimately, that's really useful to know, I think. And I think that the disappointment one might feel seeing that result, it's probably less than the disappointment one feels spending three hours to get something in through Unity, thinking it's going to work, and then it doesn't. Then you start doing research, and then you realize, oh shit, it's not supported. That's more disappointing, I think, than being told... That might be don't might be if i just repackaged your asset you could probably be idea from like three years ago don't mind me what your asset catalog idea remember with msf you were like asking uh how can we catalog all the different formats. So I was making it simpler. What can I use with this 3D asset? And that's it. I wonder if we could retroactively go back and celebrate the adoption like we can always celebrate well I mean because you know there's stuff and it was adopted but like everyone's talking like there's going to be this big vacuum but there is like support there right so it's not a vacuum, but it's kind of strange that one guy who implemented OMI Audio is just our afterthought. Why didn't we celebrate that? Why didn't we like, I don't know, collaborate with them on at least recognizing it, I guess. Yeah, no, I agree. That is something that should be happening. I mean, I'll do my best to be more conscious of those. I basically didn't even notice it as it happened. I'd forgotten about it too. And I think the folks on the Prono side, have they been actually like participating a bit when we pushed up that way? They have, right? They have. I think some of them you may try implementing it i mean that's constructive collaboration energy even if they operate kind of a little a narrow cadence right they and that that's um something that stands in contrast to the vacuum as well. And that could be something that's cool for us to do, like if we, like as Omi or something, or someone at Omi. Yeah, give me the login on Twitter, I'll throw some stuff out. I think I have the login, actually. You think that the platform potential considerers, like, where do they have the pulse on? A lot of them seem like they're heads down a lot, right, working on their thing. So, like, I wonder where they look for information like this. And if it's Twitter. Does this already exist? Like, is there a where can I use VRM or where can I use VLTF? Personally, I don't think that that's how it emerges on most products. I think, like, V GLTF is kind of understood as like this de facto standard period, right? But then when you start hitting things, you start thinking, oh, well, shit, do I want to implement this myself, right? Is there an existing standard? And then you start to look, right? You know what I'm referring to, right? There's this browser page. Can I use? No, I know. I used to bring it up all the time and I don't really use it anymore, though, because I guess I just browse the boring web that is supported everywhere. We need the boring GLTF that works everywhere. The boring 3D space. It just works everywhere. Nobody highlights it anymore because it just works. That's kind of where Blender is. Actually, the base GeoTF is at that point, right? It just kind of works. One could see what can be. I would say most things. Most KHR underscore things work. But some don't. And, yeah. Like, I mean, a good example is that GLTF kit repo that I posted earlier. They've got, they don't have support for material variants. They don't have support for XMP JSON. But what would that even mean? But everything else can render, so. but what would that even mean? But everything else can render. I noticed they don't have support but this is an EXT for WebP. I'm kind of a little bit I'm not very happy about the WebP support. It's been something that keeps coming up that some engines implement it, some don't. And I think a lot of people encourage people to use it because it makes your files smaller. It's kind of against each other, these things. I'm not a big fan of WebP, but I never really noticed it being picked up pervasively. Didn't it have some sort of problem or something? Someone was telling me recently. It's widely used now. There was a vulnerability but that's already been patched. There's also the idea that if you use WebP, it's unknown if it's compressed or not, and sometimes you want to use it for less uses. It's better than PNG for that transparency bit, though. I found it to be overall... It takes an extension to actually implement it, though. That was the part that I found kind of frustrating. Well, officially, right? I thought in a couple of places it'll work anyway, even though it's not official. It'll accept it. And that kind of thing I could imagine becoming like that. If people think of it in the same pervasiveness as JPEG and just start using it, I mean, why would an engine even stop to think that it's not supportive? It's not like people are routinely checking the spec when things are working. The thing is the WebP spec is not designed like that. It's designed to have a separate field for the WebP image. If you don't read that field then it's not used. But if I just do as JPEG does, but use a WebP then that's not suspect there that the problem is i know it's a violation of the spec i'm saying that it seems like it works in some places like so if if people are using higher level libraries and they're in their platforms frameworks and stuff where the light it doesn't really care what kind of image anymore right i don't see why they would really conform at all. Like, what's the harm to them allowing what be in? Like, I understand that it's not ideal, right? Well, the problem is that you have to, as an engine, I have just received a file, and I need to understand that, oh, they removed, the image is separate on this other node, and I've got to factor that in. So the problem is that, like, with this glTF kit repo, they just didn't even think about it. They're not anticipating hitting that extension. So then WebP images just don't work. Files actually error out if you try and use them in that tool. That's the stuff that kind of has me a little worried about audio extensions and stuff. Note that we are over time. Oh yeah, sorry. But also, on the topic, assuming we're going to keep going, on the topic of more media formats, have y'all seen the latest pull requests that I made on the GLTF extensions repo? Looking now. Vorbis? Yeah. Opus? We were discussing that a few weeks ago. I just whipped those up in one day. Oh, you're awesome. I'm going to have fun reading this. That didn't include any example files, unfortunately. This is perfect. This is everything you need to show. You don't need very much. The WebE extension, I don't think it includes any example files either. No, it doesn't. So is this... What is the state of this? Ready for review. Yeah. So next week's agenda. Yeah. And by the way i have like three open pull requests y'all are welcome to review them outside of meeting hours like you don't have to wait until it's in a meeting and we're discussing it live because you know i would like if we all come to the meeting with like an idea of what we will be we will be talking about you know yeah well i've been using this glv i thought i had approved and said yes but i just approved that one uh it's been working in my testing so that's exactly what we needed awesome i have a friend i'm gonna merge some hi-fi days who was really into trains and vehicles and stuff and gravity. I have this idea that maybe bountying in a targeted way, not just open, but like, hey, let's bring in someone who has fresh eyes and vehicle and gravity experience, literally just to sit with this only gravity spec and just get to know it and write up some notes on how they feel about it and how it strikes them right if they see anything missing kind of is like bringing in like an expert witness you know um i don't know bring in bring in more people i don't care what they're doing if they're reviewing things with fresh eyes that they're here to bring in their own ideas or here to implement something. Just bring in more people. Just do it. Do it. Okay. Yes. And I'll get on that also without this other part. But I was wondering if that could somehow fit within like the bounty kind of concept somehow where it could be kind of, hey, come in and just do a professional hour here for us and write up the thing. But from someone who either we can sponsor by knowing them or find with credentials. The gravity of the situation might call for it, right? Maybe. Credentials are good, but I would say everybody's welcome regardless of credentials, too. Yeah, I was basically trying to not be overly... I know this guy, you know? But I don't know. I don't think they... I'd have to think about how to entice them, because they won't be able to play with it outside of the demo and you'll have to imagine what it might be like to adopt it I got a lot of persuasion energy for my friend but he is working on trains and stuff another friend is working? yeah see people on trains I think they would be perfect no it's the same friend that i present be the the vehicle builder a few weeks ago oh okay well maybe a train party would do it just hey only train party we're gonna get together and talk about gravity and trains i think there'd be two people selling out I'm not sure how we can help you Aaron and help Omi and help this Omi Gravity you can help me by doing more just do something like whatever you, I'm sure it will be good. I want... If you want to come and help, I want you to work on what you think will be most helpful. Whatever that is, it's something that you will know what to do. You'll know why it's helpful. You'll know who the target audience is because you're the one proposing it. I want to know if I want to host a site that converts between GOTF to FBX or something weird like that, or, like, between the different formats, where would be a good place to host it? Say again? So you have, like, a bunch of different file types, and you want to put them where? I want to make a website that can convert between them. Oh, convert between them. Oh, I would do it in Vercel. Like, it might require, like, a, you know, CPU power. Yeah, yeah. I would do it, like, Vercel. It's super cheap. They have, like, a hobby plan. So, if you're, like, not planning on... So, I would have to convert the whole thing to Wasm. Like, I think it's, like, Python. Like, one of the pathways was Python. Maybe. Or you can just use a Cloudflare worker. They take Python now. Oh, really? Send me more links. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Tell me more about it. Send me a DM later. I'm gonna... I gotta bounce though. But it's been real. See y'all. Okay. Last one out. Turn off the bot. Please turn off the bot now. Turn off the bot now."}
