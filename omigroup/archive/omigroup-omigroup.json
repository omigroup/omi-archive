How we Collab with other groups will be a real turning point for Interoperability.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I think we can really shake things up with an experiment. I'd like to see us solve for challenge statements, and compare results. More demo days, less meeting minutes. More experimentation.

Congrats to everyone who has been involved!\r\n\r\nIn order for us to continue to grow, we need to expand our leadership team. At our meeting on April 20th at 16:00 UTC we'll kick off our election for the leadership team. OMI members will have 24 hours to approve the leadership team on Discord. We'll ping @ everyone when the vote has opened.\r\n\r\n### Leadership Team Responsibilities\r\n\r\nThe OMI leadership team will be responsible for the day to day operations of the OMI organization. This include but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n- Media\r\n  - Social Media\r\n  - Blog Writing\r\n  - Media Relations\r\n  - Production / Streaming\r\n- Finance\r\n  - Open Collective / Budget\r\n  - Grant Writing / Fundraising\r\n- Events\r\n  - Welcoming people into the community\r\n  - Demo Nights\r\n  - Lightning Talks\r\n  - Hackathons\r\n  - Workshops / teaching\r\n- Partnerships / Liaisons\r\n  - Khronos glTF Working Group\r\n  - Virtual World liaisons / ambassadors\r\n  - W3C Working Groups\r\n  - M3\r\n  - WebXR Discord\r\n  - XRSI\r\n  - And more!\r\n- General Meeting Administration\r\n  - Recording meetings\r\n  - Meeting agenda\r\n  - Meeting facilitators\r\n- Organization Administration\r\n  - Calendar / scheduling\r\n  - Progress summaries\r\n  - GitHub / Backlog\r\n- Working Group Administration\r\n  - W3C Chairs\r\n  - Spec Editors\r\n  - Working Group leadership\r\n\r\nThe leadership team will meet once a week for an hour to plan out the week's responsibilities and ensure our tasks are covered. As a member of the leadership team you should have at least one hour a week available to meet with the rest of the leadership team as well as some time to accomplish the various tasks.\r\n\r\nMembers of the leadership team should have good standing with the [W3C Community Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/) and should be role models for the rest of the community. They will be responsible for upholding these guidelines and fostering the growth of a respectful and inclusive community.\r\n\r\nLeadership team members will help steer the community via the responsibilities listed above. However, all decisions within the community will still be made via a vote by consensus. Leaders will not have any more weight than any other member in the voting process. The leadership team is responsible for acting on behalf of the community and should take in and address feedback regularly.\r\n\r\n### Election Process\r\n\r\nPeople who are interested in volunteering for the leadership team should comment below **before** April 20th at 16:00 UTC. You may also nominate other members before that time, but they must respond confirming their intention to volunteer for the leadership team.\r\n\r\nThe election will be held asynchronously, members of the community will have 24 hours to confirm members to the leadership team. Every OMI member will be able to individually vote to confirm each member. Members will be confirmed via a simple majority vote. The voting will happen in Discord and you will be notified by an @everyone ping on April 20th at 16:00 UTC.\r\n\r\nThe term for this position will be 1 year. We'll hold another election during the meeting closest to that date. If we continue holding our weekly meetings on Wednesdays, the next election will be held on April 19th 2023.\r\n\r\nLeadership team members may at any point choose to resign, but we'd ask that volunteers think about how much time they are able to commit before volunteering.\r\n\r\nAs with any OMI member, if at any point a leadership team member is deemed to have violated the W3C Community Guidelines, we will follow the [process outlined by the W3C](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/#Reporting). Repeat violations will result in the removal of that leader from their position.\r\n\r\n### Nominations\r\n\r\nNominate yourself or others in the comments below. If you have been nominated, please confirm your intent to volunteer.\r\n\r\nThank you everyone for an incredible first year at OMI and here's to many more to come!\r\n","author":{"login":"robertlong"},"comments":{"nodes":[{"id":"DC_kwDOFUbqUM4AJqZx","author":{"login":"mrmetaverse"},"body":":hand: I volunteer to continue my service.

This group would need a repo, readme, and backlog. If interested we need to submit an issue proposing the group. At the moment comms and finance and other key pieces of OMI operations are all lumped under Interoperators which may be a risk. \r\n- Portals group: https://github.com/omigroup/omigroup/issues/209 I will be submitting a proposal to form an exploratory group for portals in the metaverse, this received numerous interested parties during our workshop, and feels in-line with OMI efforts and values. \r\n- What would blogging look like? https://github.com/omigroup/website/discussions/53\r\n- DO WE WANT TO ADD TWO CHAIRS TO START? We think we can make immediate impact by adding two more chairs, while we continue to evolve as a group. Ideally, these two would fill new roles and unlock new potential for our org, as well as, fill some of the existing gaps and overages. For clarity: This would yield 5 total chairs (which may change again as we go) We have been tracking the future structure of OMI with this milestone https://github.com/omigroup/omigroup/milestone/2"},{"id":"DC_kwDOFUbqUM4AJmmU","author":{"login":"mrmetaverse"},"body":"Created blogging milestone in website group @antpb \r\n- website group milestones: https://github.com/omigroup/website/milestones?with_issues=no \r\n- first blog issue: https://github.com/omigroup/website/issues/54"},{"id":"DC_kwDOFUbqUM4AJmqx","author":{"login":"robertlong"},"body":"![Screen Shot 2022-04-06 at 10 00 04 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1753624/162028309-98a31b9d-9aa7-42aa-8940-9a83f9dc730f.png)\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-04-06 at 10 00 38 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1753624/162028411-904b85ba-be88-4bf2-838c-0c82fa603d8a.png)\r\n "}]},"labels":{"nodes":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMzM2MTIxOTU0","name":"Consistently deliver value","color":"1B9AAA","description":"We incrementally discover and deliver  value with intent"}]}},{"id":"D_kwDOFUbqUM4APJvm","category":{"name":"Weekly Meetings"},"upvoteCount":1,"updatedAt":"2022-04-06T15:54:15Z","createdAt":"2022-03-29T14:37:54Z","number":203,"title":"03/30/22 Weekly Meeting 49 Agenda","body":"Weekly Meeting 49 is happening on Wednesday March 30th, 2022 from 8:30 AM PDT(15:30 UTC) - 10:30 AM PDT (17:30 UTC)\r\n\r\nYou can add it to your calendar [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/1?cid=Y18wZHB1Z2Y5ZjgzZXE0cWVrbWI2b21xYmptZ0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t).\r\n \r\nWe'll be meeting again in the omi-weekly-meeting channel of the [AngellXR/OMI Discord](https://discord.gg/NJtT9grz5E).\r\n\r\n## Who we are and why we're here:\r\n\r\nThe Open Metaverse Interoperability Group (OMI) is focused on bridging virtual worlds by designing and promoting protocols for identity, social graphs, inventory, and more.

There are some groups that are in fact creating standards, working in such a way that W3C requires signing the contributor license agreement through W3C. This signs over the patents or IP to W3C as an organization. This helps ensure that a contributor can't go back on their contributions later, ripping out the spec from underneath you after you have built on top of it. This is very important for the specification groups. In short, this does require that an individual use their \"real name.\" This can pose as a challenge to many contributors to OMI overall. So if your group is NOT producing a specification or standard, it may not require that you sign the contributor license agreement. At the working group level, based on which type of work they are doing, it is encouraged that you have this discussion up-front and publish in your readme / working agreement if your group intends to recommend specifications which would require the signing of this agreement.

We have an election coming up on February 2nd and we'd like to get feedback from the community on how we'd like to proceed as a group. Based on the [task list Jesse and I compiled](https://hackmd.io/bDrL7EC6THSEU_RU7SsNXw), here are some positions that I think might fit us better than 3 general chairs. I think one person should be able to hold multiple of these roles. Currently the 3 chairs handle a couple of these responsibilities at a time, but breaking it out into more roles allows us to better delegate responsibilities.\r\n\r\n## Leadership Proposal:\r\n\r\n### Steering Committee (3-5?):\r\n  - Handles inbound partnership opportunities and reaches out to potential partners to further OMI's mission\r\n  - Made up of a group of people who can speak on behalf of OMI on various topics\r\n  - Communicates new partnership opportunities with the group and represents them when talking to prospective partners\r\n  - Responsible for managing OMI's budget and assets based on the decisions set out by the group\r\n  - Responsible for ensuring GitHub issues/discussions dealing with partnerships, budget, or organization responsibilities are brought to the group's attention and are resolved.\r\n\r\n### General Meeting Moderators (2-3):\r\n - Helps create the agenda with the other moderators\r\n - Runs through the agenda\r\n - Moderates the call:\r\n   - Manages speaker queue when necessary\r\n   - Ensures people are given their time to speak\r\n   - Invites others to join in on the conversation\r\n   - Mutes users if they are having microphone issues\r\n   - Enforces our Code of Conduct during the call\r\n   - Runs votes during the call\r\n - Responsible for ensuring the meeting is recorded and notes are being taken. They don't have to be the ones taking notes/recording but they do need to make sure it's happening and they are distributed publicly.\r\n - Regularly runs retrospective meetings to check in on the health of our community\r\n - Responsible for ensuring GitHub issues/discussions dealing with new proposals for events, working groups, or other work items are brought to the group's attention and resolved.\r\n \r\n### Working Group Chairs (1-2 per group):\r\n  - Same as the general meeting but applied to individual working groups\r\n  - Also responsible for adhering to the W3C process and ensuring that proper IP protection policies are followed\r\n  - Listed under the W3C metaverse-interop group as chairs\r\n  - Responsible for moderating and organizing the working group's GitHub\r\n\r\n### Social Media Manager:\r\n  - Our public voice for OMI on social media\r\n  - Sends out updates on meetings, events, and projects happening within our communities\r\n  - Creates and maintains content that is in line with our community's values\r\n  \r\n### Event Manager: \r\n  - Helps schedule and run regularly occurring events within our community\r\n  - Examples include Demo Days, Twitter Spaces, Hackathons, Field Trips, etc.\r\n  \r\n### Discord Moderators (as many as we want):\r\n  - Welcomes new users and helps them find their way in the community\r\n  - Enforces our Code of Conduct throughout the server\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nIn summary, I think we still need a leadership body. I think that we should continue to divide those responsibilities and power. I think that a steering committee will be able to handle these outward facing interactions with other organizations that require us to have one or two people speaking on behalf of the group at a time. This comes up when responding to press, speaking opportunities, and in negotiating partnerships.\r\n\r\nI think we should split up the other tasks the chairs and other members of our community have taken on into explicit roles which I've outlined above. I'm not sure that these encompass everything we need yet, but it's what I can come up with now and I'd love to hear from all of you on how you might structure this differently.\r\n\r\n**If you are interested in filling one of these roles, please nominate yourself here! We'd love the help!**\r\n\r\nPlease, if you have time to chime in on this subject, do so before our next meeting on January 19th so we can discuss this then.\r\n\r\nThanks everyone!","author":{"login":"robertlong"},"comments":{"nodes":[{"id":"DC_kwDOFUbqUM4AHeCE","author":{"login":"robertlong"},"body":"Oh, also I think we should separate the Steering Committee roles from W3C chairs.

Everyone should also feel able to step down and back in as they are comfortable and available.\r\n\r\nWith the extensions group as an example I could see chairs volunteering themselves as maintainers of certain components to give updates in meetings and verify process and stages of an extension lifecycle. Audio Emitter has been naturally taking shape. That's one component for instance I personally would be comfortable maintaining and shepherding implementations going forward. I think as more glTF extensions are added the group will need much more help organizing the different stages of proposals and implementations. All of those processes can come with time as we learn more about the role in practice, but that is one area I think would need 2 or more folks as chair representation to start. These reps should make it a goal of the term to document the tips/responsibilities for the next election. (something I'd feel eager and comfortable taking on for gltf-extensions if it makes sense and is agreed by the group 😄  )\r\n\r\nI think one way to avoid perceived power and a need for term limits would be to give a cool title to people that have served in a role and stepped down. They helped make the metaverse more open and they should be able to celebrate that without having to hold a position.

(The destination grid may not want spacesuits in their cowboy sim.) Some of the browser-based virtual worlds already have this.\r\n\r\n* Asset portability - you should be able to take your stuff from one grid to another, if the destination grid accepts it. This is what NFTs claim to do, but rarely do in reality. This may already be a legal right in EU countries, per Article 20 of the GDPR, \"Data Portability\".\r\n\r\n* Money portability - you should be able to spend and withdraw money on a grid without being locked into its payment system. Epic is currently fighting Apple over this.\r\n\r\n(\"Grid\" here means a virtual world or worlds under coordinated management.) \r\n\r\n## Example Use Cases\r\n\r\nThe portal case is obvious, since some web-based VR systems already have portals to other systems. Portals between Roblox games are common, but do not usually cross the boundary between grid operators. Open Simulator systems can have portals between grids under different management. Going from one system to another involves either compatible clients or loading a new client program. Both cases should be supported.\r\n\r\nAsset portability is a tough problem. NVidia is working on file formats for that. This is more about how the user does it from inside a virtual world. Can you carry your stuff through a portal?\r\n\r\nMoney portability is controversial. The standardization issue is that that buyer A, service provider B, money transfer service C, and seller D should be able to achieve a successful transaction in a reasonably standard way. If money transfer service C is acceptable to buyer A and seller D, technical integration between service provider B and money transfer service C should not be required.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nWeb-based virtual world systems can already move between worlds via URL. Most of the hard problems involve what you can take with you. In any case, this needs to be easy and seamless, or we don't have a metaverse, just a collection of disconnected systems. \r\n\r\nAsset portability at the file level can build on the GLTF/USD standard. That doesn't address permissions, identity, copyright, and ownership issues. The first step is probably a best practices document for discussion. \r\n\r\nMoney portability is about payment APIs, of which there are many. Too many. NACHA, which runs the US interbank ACH network, has new APIs coming out to make payments easier without being locked into a single payment provider. ACH has traditionally been somewhat clunky, but that's being fixed. Piggyback on that work. In the EU, there are Single European Payment Area standards. While metaverse operators may offer their own payment system or currency, it should always be possible to use these standard banking systems if the user desires. Cryptocurrency payments are a separate subject.

That's closely related to \"portals\".\r\n\r\nOpenSimulator, the closest thing we have now to a working distributed metaverse, defines the externally visible properties of each grid in [this way][http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Hypergrid_Parameters].\r\n\r\nThat document defines a \"Gatekeeper URI\". This is a URL which allows entering the grid via a HTTP request. That starts the login process. It may contain parameters which specify a location within the grid. A Decentraland gatekeeper URI looks like this: \"https://play.decentraland.org/?position=1%2C-1&realm=hephaestus\". So there's already some consensus that a URI is the entrance point for a metaverse grid.\r\n\r\nThe Open Simulator document also discusses some basic permission issues, such as whether the grid will accept connections from external portals at all.\r\n\r\nSo, that's a starting point.\r\n\r\nThe next question is, having found the grid, what protocol is used to talk to it? We're not going to get everybody using the same client. So we need to figure out how you portal to something that needs to load a different client.

So metaverse components can state what \"level\" or capability map they can support.. but there might be fall back positions able to be supported for later more advanced versions.

There are two main cases - the URL can be interpreted by the client you're currently running, or some other client needs to be loaded. The latter has the usual problems with untrusted content causing program loading, so some security limits there are required. This is probably a solveable problem.\r\n\r\n* single portable avatar format \r\n\r\nThat's a tough one. One approach is outsourced avatars. That's Ready Player Me. All avatar customization takes place on the Ready Player Me site. Games and virtual worlds use a proprietary rendering module to render Ready Player Me avatars. This gives Ready Player Me a clothing monopoly. \r\n\r\nWhile a single proprietary system is not the way to go, the concept that avatars are independent of the world in which they are currently present is worth exploring, now that we have an example of a system where that works.\r\n\r\nThis has major performance implications. Remember, all this has to run in real time. We can't affoird the overheads of a web browser, where you need a gigabyte and a billion MIPS to display a page of text and a cat picture.

VRM 1.0 may remove this requirement, opening up the possibility of preserving the original rig rotations.\r\n\r\nSince Unity is widely used, it has made VRM adoption pretty straightforward for many platforms. On the web, Three.js also has an extremely [well-maintained library for VRM](https://github.com/pixiv/three-vrm) thanks to Pixiv, Inc.\r\n\r\nGiven all the consensus around it, it seems fair to use VRM as a standard upon to base any work we do related to humanoid skeletons. I agree that non-humanoid is an open problem. Some platforms use \"rotation constraints\" as a way to allow copying rotations from one limb to another in non-human characters. VRM 1.0 includes support for such constraints. But ideally, we can do even better. In my view, it might be worth basing some work on second life's extensions for tail and extra limbs, but within the GLTF or VRM framework."},{"id":"DC_kwDOFUbqUM4AVWph","author":{"login":"John-Nagle"},"body":"[Denavit-Hartenberg notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denavit%E2%80%93Hartenberg_parameters) might be helpful here.

It's important that the metaverse is inclusive from the start and does not leave people with disability isolated. I believe we need to reinvent the way we guide disabled people through interactive worlds.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important aspects of making the metaverse accessible is a cross-compatible avatar. With so many platforms arising in the metaverse the compatibility of an avatar is the first step towards accessibility. A standardised set of rules could be made for avatars which would allow the same avatar to travel through different platforms and interact in the same way. Once that is achieved then a set of guidelines could be made that determine the labeling programmatically of a scene in the metaverse so that people, objects, and terrain can be interpreted.\r\n\r\nOnce cross-compatibility of the avatar has been implemented then a new way of interacting with the metaverse should be made. Just as screenreaders navigated the internet an \"AI Guide Dog\" could navigate the metaverse. The AI dog would interpret the scene and handle the navigation of the metaverse. It could describe objects, groups of people, and the terrain and architecture of the scene without overloading the user with information. It could accept commands to navigate the scene and interact with objects.","author":{"login":"gregm-mwb"},"comments":{"nodes":[{"id":"DC_kwDOFUbqUM4AHL6R","author":{"login":"mrmetaverse"},"body":"This is both a cute idea, and very important one. Inclusion and accessibility are paramount to getting the next iteration of the web right. I love the idea of an AI Guide Dog assisting Metaverse explorers. One thing that comes to mind though is the creative control of those who are designing and shaping Worlds / experiences. Interoperable avatars may work for some, but not for others. For example, if someone created a game like Half Life, they may not want your toon character in their World. It might clash with the design aesthetic or overall immersion they are going for. So just because we _can_ have interoperable avatars, that doesn't always mean that we will or should. \r\n\r\nWe want to be mindful of creators. If we impose to strict of rules, or standards, some creators will reject the effort entirely. You can have the best protocol in the World, but it is useless if nobody adopts it. Therefore, I do get nervous about hinging the entire success of a plan on one piece of interoperability. Whether its avatars, inventory, or traversal. Some creators will not want it in their creations.

See https://twitter.com/simulacracid/status/1299079649784287232, Stella explains what it is. As well, see https://github.com/TrevorFSmith/stellar-mesh/wiki. I do think some modifications would help, including having a Stellar Mesh browser/manager to launch runnables from URLs. But overall, I think this is great.\r\n\r\nSo why not use the old method of a web browser/electron and native apps? For one, browser engines are way too bloated. It takes teams of hundreds of engineers years to make an engine, which explains why only 3 major ones exist. 1 engine is trying to do everything on the web, from HTML to CSS to JS to WebGL to WASM to WebXR to WebGPU to web payments to even wallets now. No small team could ever hope to maintain this, so the Stellar Mesh splits this up into engines that can handle the things a runnable needs to without all the extras. Another big issue is the web vs native vs bytecode wars. They're all good at different things, and no 1 is the best.\r\n\r\nAnother issue is that talking between web and native apps is a massive hassle by putting it through a browser and piping it out that way. It's a massive hassle with no 2-way communication, and any deeper communication requires altering web standards on a massive scale or compromising security. Since Stellar Mesh puts web and native and bytecode apps on the same level, they can talk to each other like siblings instead of being at different distances to each other.\r\n\r\nIf we want to bridge the Metaverse, having a bunch of apps with no clear communication channels between them is a massive pain that will only grow as everyone has a new protocol or engine they want to try. With Stellar Mesh, they can make an engine and a runnable, and it'll work amongst others. Many of OMI's avatar and item and portal proposals are a nightmare hopping between platforms while being unable to share any data app to app directly, but with Stellar Mesh you can just directly send that data over. Portaling between experiences is much easier when you can have a 2-way conversation as siblings to make a smooth handoff instead of the web/native divide we have now. Even Kim's IPSME idea is well executed in the Stellar Mesh.\r\n\r\nUnlike many proposals on making OSes that only do web or integrated metaverse wannabes that have carefully curated content, Stellar Mesh does not attempt to replace the OS. You can always run programs outside of it if you want to, but they won't have first-class abilities to connect to other apps and there's no guarantee of sandboxing. But in Stellar Mesh, engines can be as wild as they want with new features and ideas and architectures, using native or bytecode or web or whatever while still being interoperable. Instead of having to install the dotnet runtime, mono runtime, JVM, web engine, WASM runtime, C++ libraries, etc. all to the system causing instability, engines group all the needed dependencies in a nice package without slowdown or inflexibility.\r\n\r\nThis will be a fair bit of work, but there is already precedent for this system. Flatpak on Linux already has a strikingly similar structure with its apps being Stellar Mesh's runnables, backends being engines, having containerization, and portals being capabilities. Even Stellar Mesh's advertisements are perfectly summed up in Linux's D-Bus object-oriented cross-app messaging system (though in Stardust the UX of advertisements will be different). With Stellar Mesh's architecture and OMI protocols, I think this is the best way to organize the metaverse. Problem is, it's a lot of work and nobody's doing it.\r\n\r\nAdvertisements would be where OMI shines, from possible crypto wallet info being sent through there to federated identity to world URIs/URLs to assets. A user can always cut off an advertisement at any time with good UX, so nobody is forced to use crypto or have their identity sent across apps or such.\r\n\r\nFrom a user perspective, they'd be able to go on their universal search and search up a runnable to use. Then, if they like it they can \"install\" it which would move it from the cache to more permanent storage. They could always cut off internet access to it so it's offline and private, control what data goes into it, etc. This means they can try it out temporarily and then decide they like it. Paid apps can be done through internet verification or a cryptographic way of unlocking the engine when a certain code is downloaded for that exact copy or such, maybe even an NFT. Updates for runnables/engines would go through feeds similar to PWAs/package repositories or directly, but the manager would ensure nobody is forced to update if they don't want to. Stellar Mesh works with the package manager/app store model, PWA model, instant app model, and even webpage model. But it would never be locked into any one of those.\r\n\r\nStellar Mesh deserves its own organization partnering with OMI, but since it isn't even a prototype yet I think OMI should be the ones to kickstart it. I don't have time to make it myself, Stella and Trevor don't, etc. But I think together everyone at OMI does, and it'd be worth it. It combines the best ideas of existing and new technology to make a system that can't be locked down easily yet is easier to manage and understand.","author":{"login":"technobaboo"},"comments":{"nodes":[{"id":"MDE3OkRpc2N1c3Npb25Db21tZW50MTA4NDc1NQ==","author":{"login":"mrmetaverse"},"body":"Stellar mesh seems like a wonderful pursuit, and potentially powerful foundation for an open metaverse. Thank you for using the format of discussions for this. This will require a much larger conversation. I'd be curious to see an implementation. \n\nKeep in mind \"not having time for a this\" is a challenge many members will be facing here. What does baseline look like, and why should we focus on that baseline? \n\nAnother thing that comes to mind, OMI is meant to form protocols and isn't in the business of creating businesses. An effort of this magnitude would depend on a product partner, especially given limited bandwidth. I think the best chance to see this move forward, is to break down some of the work and consider where to begin. \n\nIf we can put our finger on a starting point as a group, there may be more willingness to get it started.

Use [TTS reader](https://ttsreader.com/) to have it read to you. \r\n \r\n### **# 1. The Metaverse is not possible with mouse and keyboard**\r\n\r\nAs Metaverse enthusiasts, it's important to remember that we are likely the top 0.1% of computer users. Most people are confused by technology, overwhelmed by options and worried if they push the wrong button they will destroy something. \r\n\r\nRecently, Chrome added the copy and paste function to the menu of Chrome because so many people misunderstood how to actually copy and paste. \r\n\r\nSince the Metaverse simulates the countless possibilities of physical life, the complexity of the user interface gets out of hand quickly.\r\n\r\nI remember testing out Second Life and accidentally taking off my pants and being unable to put them back on for 20 minutes.\r\n\r\nClearly, mouse and keyboard would not be a sufficient way of interacting with the metaverse.\r\n****\r\n\r\n### **# 2. No significant social organization arises out of putting people in a virtual space**\r\n\r\n18 years ago, Second Life came out and the hype around the Metaverse future was just as real back then as it is today. You can visit the empty government buildings, brand showcases and  cities to get a taste of the forgotten glory.\r\n\r\nTime and time again people have been put together in a virtual space, and we still went back to physical life for real connections.\r\n\r\nWe have to ask ourselves, why did we leave virtual worlds and go back to physical life?\r\n\r\nOMI Note: _I see Second Life for example as having failed at creating the Metaverse._ \r\n****\r\n\r\n### **# 3. The nature of virtual spaces leads to shallow relationships**\r\n\r\nThe great benefits of any relationship are usually found in the most challenging operations of cooperation, marriage is a great example. Dating is exciting but sharing a life with someone is deeply sacrificial and yet, the benefits of marriage are enormous. \r\n\r\nIn  digital worlds we scarcely invest as heavily in relationships as in physical life. When we can go anywhere, be with anyone it's easy to constantly look for greener grass. \r\n\r\nThis problem is accentuated by the ability to change your name/avatar at will. When people can burn others and simply change their identity to escape consequences, they do. Investing is a real reputation and a single identity is the first step to solving this issue. \r\n\r\n** **\r\n### **# 4. The Metaverse will arise from a gaming world**\r\n\r\nIn digital worlds, we find ourselves mixed in with people from different cultures who have different values and interests. By contrast, in physical life we are naturally segmented with people who are more likely to share our values and ideas. \r\n\r\nGaming has the power to break ice between people and therefore has intrinsic utility to the Metaverse.\r\n\r\nBy using gamification we can organize and connect people of similar interests and values in a virtual space. \r\n\r\nNot only that, gaming has the power to get people to relax. Human beings don’t develop meaningful friendships when forced into it. This is what social games and “virtual life” games often get wrong. Actual gameplay builds the context we need to relax and have a conversation to find people we are compatible with. \r\n\r\n** **\r\n### **# 5. Reciprocating facial expressions are necessary for cooperative human behavior**\r\n\r\nIf you've ever lifted a baby and smiled at it, you know that facial expressions are deeply embedded in how we communicate. When we hurt someone's feelings, their facial expressions changes and, as we reciprocate their facial expressions, our body produces the same emotions as we make that individual feel. This acts as a natural tempering of our behaviour that we don't yeah when we communicate over the internet.\r\n\r\n\r\n### **# 6. Customization is the enemy of usability**\r\n\r\nIt's fascinating to bump into so many people who share the idea that no corporation should control the future of human interaction. However, it's laughable that we're using the same ill-advised ideas that allowed Facebook, Google and apps to dominate when it comes to this next chapter. \r\n\r\nOne of the reasons that Facebook overtook MySpace was that MySpace allowed people to customize their profile infinitely. This led to a myriad of different user interfaces, confusing navigation and a poor user experience. \r\n\r\nJust imagine a myriad of virtual worlds all with their own user interface, controls and standards. The experience of travelling from world to world would be like being born all over again and having to learn how to read and write. \r\n\r\nTherefore, the virtual world must have a single user experience to reach mass adoption. \r\n\r\n** **\r\n### **# 7. Item interoperability is unlikely**\r\n\r\nI keep hearing from people who believe that in the future, NFT items will be taken between games and virtual worlds. I sometimes wonder if any of these people have actually designed a video game. \r\n\r\nI'm in the process of making one now and  the thing you discover very quickly is that everything in a video game is intentional. \r\n\r\nFor example; if you have a character in your world, all the items in your world fit the style, height and width of that character. \r\n\r\nLet’s say you introduced a car from one game into another. That car could: \r\n\r\n(1) Not fit the style of the game\r\n(2) Break the game balance, giving the player an advantage\r\n(3) Not fit how light reflects in the game\r\n(4) Have a different control interface \r\n(5) Be too wide for the road\r\n(6) Have the steering wheel on the wrong side \r\n(7) Create uncalculated physical results, resulting in a car that sends other cars to space\r\n\r\nAnd the list goes on. \r\n\r\n** **\r\n### **# 8. The network effect would eventually push everyone to a single virtual world**\r\n\r\nA long time ago, there was a single company that dominated the telephone market. To call anybody who was the customer of the company you needed to have a phone that was with that same company, phones were not interoperable. Today, if you want to contact somebody on Facebook, you need Facebook to do so. This is how social networks defend their intellectual property.\r\n\r\nMeta executive Jason Rubin: \r\n\r\n“The first metaverse that gains real traction is likely to the be the last,” Rubin wrote. “We must act first, and go big, or we risk being one of those wannabes.” - CNBC\r\n\r\nThe network effect is a scary prospect because it means that there will likely be only one Metaverse to rule them all in the end.\r\n\r\n** **\r\n### **# 9. AR and not VR will make the Metaverse mainstream**\r\n\r\nVirtual reality headsets have been pitched as a game changer for years now. However, very few people feel comfortable obstructing the entirety of their vision to enter our “geek world''. I think we have to accept that even though we love the medium it's unlikely to have mass adoption anytime soon. \r\n\r\nAugmented reality will allow people to continue their lives as they begin to adopt the new virtual way of doing things. \r\n\r\nCEO of Apple on AR: \r\n\r\n“...one of these very few profound technologies that we will look back on one day and ask, ‘How did we live our lives without it?’”\r\n\r\n** **\r\n### **# 10. Distributed governance is necessary to limit censorship**\r\n\r\nIf any one platform is responsible for the content on the Metaverse, it will be torn apart by that responsibility. Human beings have never agreed on morals and values and to one person black is white and white is black. We are slowly coming out of an incredible era of tolerance which is abnormal for human beings. \r\n\r\nWe have spent thousands of years of our history destroying each other over needless inconsequential arguments about small religious differences etc. \r\n\r\nAs power moves to the virtual space instead of the physical, everyone is going to be pushing the power broker, the Metaverse platform, to impose their sense of morality on others. \r\n\r\nEventually these arguments will inevitably tear apart the Metaverse unless responsibility for individual nodes is decentralized. \r\n\r\n** **\r\n### **# 11. The Metaverse has the power to become a dystopian nightmare** \r\n\r\nAs the network effect brings everyone to a single Metaverse, the potential for the abuse of power will be astronomical. The Metaverse will understand where you are, who you are with and even what you look at. \r\n\r\nAI will be able to process that data to better understand you than you yourself and data is the first step toward oppression. \r\n\r\nUtilizing all this data, powerful individuals will have the ability to suppress dissent, identify people of contrarian opinion etc. \r\n\r\nMoreover, if we begin to fool ourselves that we can agree on morals and values, those who disagree with the mainstream will live in constant fear of losing their friends, job and opportunities if they are banned from the Metaverse. \r\n \r\n ** **\r\n### **# 12. Decentralization will not aide data protection** \r\n\r\nThe web as we know it today is a well distributed system, however, it provides no real protection for our data. Every website constantly scrambles after our data and what companies know about us is incalculable. Fortunately, the amount of data makes driving conclusions difficult right now but in the future AI will solve that problem. \r\n\r\nIf decentralization isn't protecting us, there is no reason it will protect us in the Metaverse. \r\n\r\n** **\r\n### **# 13. Censorship is necessary to create community** \r\n\r\nEvery space in the physical world has some sort of rules to follow. A library asks us to be quiet, a classroom to be respectful and a workplace to be professional. In the same way creators of spaces must be empowered to moderate the spaces they watch over to create a sense of identity in the space which will help it facilitate connections. \r\n\r\n** **\r\n### **# 14. Open source _may_ not be the answer**\r\n\r\nWith the advantages of usability of having only one way of doing things in a virtual space, embrace, extend, extinguish takes on a whole new meaning. \r\n\r\nIt's too easy for those who would profit from our collaborative efforts to use those efforts to create a singular Metaverse which is more usable and then use the “import but don’t export” model to bring in the best of virtual worlds without allowing anything out of their world. \r\n\r\nTotal freedom everywhere will just lead to chaos. \r\n** **\r\n** **\r\n** **\r\n** **\r\n** **\r\n** **\r\n### Although I would like your feedback on all the points, I would love to point out how the most relevant points pertain to open source:\r\n\r\nPlease understand that I mention these with the idea that I will be corrected and I hope to be corrected. \r\n\r\n4. The Metaverse will arise from a gaming world\r\n6. Customization is the enemy of usability\r\n7. Item interoperability is unlikely\r\n8. The network effect would eventually push everyone to a single virtual world\r\n12. Decentralization will not aide data protection\r\n\r\n\r\n### # 4. The Metaverse will arise from a gaming world\r\n\r\nSince the metaverse will arise out of a gaming world, we need a publisher of games to make the metaverse. I know that sounds convoluted but creating fun is a very difficult art and the number one comment I get from inhabitants of these metal versus is they don't know what the point of staying. One day it's like the internet and there will be a lot of points to stay there but in the meantime you need to have people cooperating and collaborating and that happens through gaming very often and gaining is a great way to break the ice between people so it's a really necessary step.\r\n\r\nThis is partially why there's so many metaverses and nothing has really taken off, they are not fun. I know I'm talking to the Second Life crowd mostly, but let's be honest, Second Life was positioned to be an incredible metaverse but it fell way below expectations and I believe the reason for that is behavioral psychology and not technology. \r\n\r\n\r\n### # 6. Customization is the enemy of usability\r\n\r\nDevelopers tend to love lots of options, while users hate them. \r\n\r\nApple is famous for taking away all the possibilities and their consumers are fanboys of products that have been falling behind for a long time (I am an Apple iOS user and I prefer it to Android). \r\n\r\nGaming consoles are a great example in that it takes away the functionality of your computer that you are buying from them in order to give you much less features and charge you a price for that. There is literally no reason for gaming consoles to exist except to satisfy users that are confused by computers. This does not include Switch. \r\n\r\nLinux is a mine field full of distributions and is a terrible user experience on desktop. No one is developing for a platform with so many distributions because it is simply ludicrous. \r\n\r\nOpen source games I have so many issues bringing in users because the people that develop the experience are the hardcore users and those hardcore users cater to hardcore play. I play a game called ZeroK daily because I am a hardcore gamer… it's more of a religion than a game because it's so complicated. \r\n\r\n\r\n### # 7. Item interoperability is unlikely\r\n\r\nHere is another point where I think that developers vastly underestimate how confused people are by visiting virtual worlds. A virtual world has a different way of using its controls. Every virtual world has different gravity, controls, and standards (like how to know what an NPC is).\r\n\r\nWhen people are divorced from the people who use their product and live in a little bubble where everyone speaks their language and their way of thinking they tend to make horrendous mistakes concerning usability. \r\n\r\nTime and time again open source projects fail at usability and user acquisition due to a low budget and due to what I call the “developer bubble effect.” \r\n\r\nEach one of us lives in a bubble and we all experience the world in a totally unique way. We start out in life thinking that everyone is like us. However, there's a very strong distinction between people who understand things in a logical sequence and people who understand things in a very vague way. \r\n\r\nI'm definitely the latter, and it's very common for social people to be the latter. The reason for this is because human beings are incredibly diverse and people who are great with social skills are great at jumping between two different worlds without context. \r\n\r\nMost great engineers understand the world in a logical sequence of events. They have a different way of visualizing the world (they see things very differently) where they understand all the little in between bits where most of us don't and don't want to. This is why I often programmers are slow to speak compared to others. They like to know what they're saying and they're like to know how to make sure to say it very precisely. This is also why Reddit and stackoverflow are really annoying places to be for most people because everyone is so darn precise. Programmers need to be precise and being precise is too slow when it comes to jumping from person to person quickly and making connections and contacts like people like me do.\r\n\r\nOur weekly meetings are a good example. We have tons of people and very few of them speak and that's because developers are by and large less social than your average person. \r\n\r\n\r\n### 8 is going to require another article 😂\r\n\r\n\r\n### # 12. Decentralization will not aide data protection\r\n\r\nI don't want the Metaverse to look anything like the web because the web did nothing for our privacy. The web model, in my mind, will definitely lead to oppression when put in the context of a virtual space. \r\n\r\nIf I look at GDPR It’s done nothing for privacy on the web. \r\n\r\nAn open source web will definitely face the same challenges because there is no controller on the system. My proposition is that we can control the system ourselves. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOpen source doesn't lead to enough control in order to hammer out these issues because only one person's vision is going to make this work and if there's too many visions and too many cooks in the kitchen were actually going to get a terrible user experience leading to a capitulation to a centralized virtual world owned by a cooperation and not a community. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","author":{"login":"RedEagleP1"},"comments":{"nodes":[{"id":"DC_kwDOFUbqUM4AG7k3","author":{"login":"fire"},"body":"Copied my discussion from Discord here.\r\n\r\nAppreciate the ask for usability.\r\n\r\nDisclosure: These are positional statements where if I didn't want to do opensource work, I could have gotten a regular job ha.

Here are my opinions:\r\n\r\n> 1. The Metaverse is not possible with mouse and keyboard\r\n\r\nI don't agree that this is a given. https://hubs.mozilla.com/ is my favorite example of a multi-modal metaverse. You can use hubs from VR, or a browser tab on your desktop or phone. It is comparatively fiddly to navigate a virtual world when not in VR, but I think it is very important to be able to do this. It enables people who cannot join in an immersive capacity - as a matter of ongoing capability or momentary circumstance - to participate.\r\n\r\nThe metaverse isn't just for people who can see, or who have all their limbs, or who don't have children to take care of (and so can afford to shut out the world around them for hours at a time). It should have modalities that make it accessible to as many people as possible.\r\n\r\nRegardless of whether or not you agree: this seems orthogonal to \"open source\" vs. any alternative.\r\n\r\n> 2. No significant social organization arises out of putting people in a virtual space\r\n\r\nThis measure of the metaverse is too narrow for my liking. Minecraft is part of the metaverse. Every MMORPG is part of the metaverse. The metaverse is the reality that we are collectively hallucinating when we congregate in virtual spaces. And, there has been an incredible amount of social organization in these spaces. [People get married](https://mashable.com/article/final-fantasy-wedding), [build incredible works of art](https://westeroscraft.com/), [pick up job skills](https://money.cnn.com/2014/06/19/technology/world-of-warcraft-resume/index.html) and [execute sophisticated and verse-shattering political coups](https://www.pcgamer.com/inside-the-biggest-heist-in-eve-online-history/).\r\n\r\nIt's worth keeping in mind that just because you aren't part of the social organization doesn't mean it doesn't exist and isn't doing anything.\r\n\r\nRegardless of whether or not you agree: this seems orthogonal to \"open source\" vs. any alternative.\r\n\r\n> 3. The nature of virtual spaces leads to shallow relationships\r\n\r\nAlthough many of my closest relationships were formed outside of a metaverse, most of the daily socializing I do with those people (and others) happens in a game, or on a channel like Discord. This has been especially true during the pandemic. I don't consider these relationships to be shallow just because we aren't spending time together in person every day.\r\n\r\nI also haven't found fluid identity to be the main contributor to toxic relationships. In fact, I would go farther and say that the most toxic people I know in virtual contexts have public, \"real name\" identities on social media channels like Twitter and Facebook.\r\n\r\nRegardless of whether or not you agree: this seems orthogonal to \"open source\" vs. any alternative.\r\n\r\n> 4. The Metaverse will arise from a gaming world\r\n\r\nThis doesn't seem particularly controversial, although personally I consider almost any digital social context to be at least adjacent to the metaverse.\r\n\r\nThis seems orthogonal to \"open source\" vs. any alternative.\r\n\r\n> 5. Reciprocating facial expressions are necessary for cooperative human behavior\r\n\r\nI think it certainly helps, but is not necessary. There are lots of proof points for cooperative human behavior absent the ability to see each other face to face.\r\n\r\nRegardless of whether or not you agree: this seems orthogonal to \"open source\" vs. any alternative.\r\n\r\n> 6. Customization is the enemy of usability\r\n\r\nThis dynamic is a spectrum, not binary. It's definitely worth meditating on.\r\n\r\nRegardless of whether or not you agree: this seems orthogonal to \"open source\" vs. any alternative.\r\n\r\n> 7. Item interoperability is unlikely\r\n\r\nI wrote a response to this particular section in Discord, so copying it here:\r\n\r\n> Just to contribute some food for thought regarding NFTs:\r\n> \r\n> It seems unlikely that the popular conception of NFTs will lend itself to any kind of broad-based item portability. Hot loading untrusted assets at runtime in a game presents a lot of obvious challenges and complexity (from a game developer's perspective, anyway).\r\n>\r\n> It does seem likely that some channels will attempt to use NFTs this way. Good luck to them. It will be interesting to see what kinds of solutions they attempt to address the challenges on the table.\r\n>\r\n> My theory is that we will see NFTs used in a licensing/revenue share context in a way that fosters emergent portability across games/verses. Consider this scenario:\r\n>\r\n> - Nike publishes a purchasable NFT for a metaverse-exclusive shoe style. The NFT includes reference art that can be displayed in a storefront, or a user profile\r\n> - The NFT is coupled with a smart contract (perhaps one that forms a DAO) that implements a revenue sharing scheme for any channel that implements channel-native content that is faithful to the reference design\r\n> - Game producers create art/items in the image of the reference design that fit within the technical and visual architecture of their game. When integrated, they apply for a share of the revenue from all sales of the NFT\r\n>\r\n> This regime would have a few virtuous qualities:\r\n>\r\n> - Nike can sell metaverse assets directly to customers without depending on every game/verse to mediate the sale\r\n> - Games can be compensated for integrating support for digital assets, with the potential for income from both direct sales and resales of digital assets\r\n> - Users can have some real expectation of item portability\r\n>\r\n> There are some challenges with this approach as well. For example, it becomes very difficult over time for a game producer to keep up with the sheer quantity of digital goods that could be produced. It may be possible for standardized asset formats to help with this to some extent, but it's really hard to address this in a generalized way that also matches the specific artistic look of a particular game.\r\n>\r\n> Another challenge is that just like licensing in the real world, there will be friction in the artistic review process, and legal headwinds when it comes to counterfeit branded content.\r\n>\r\n> There is always the obvious question: do you even need NFTs to make this happen?\r\n>\r\n> I don't necessarily think you do. But, it is hard to ignore how many brands are beginning to invest in NFTs right now, and Nike in particular just acquired an NFT avatar / clothing startup this week.\r\n>\r\n> The question comes down to: who controls the marketplace. There is a problem with saying: \"Nike controls the marketplace.\" That gives Nike a ton of unilateral control/power over the marketplace. Blockchain seems like a credible neutral medium for transactions. But, we don't need blockchains to form a neutral marketplace. It is just the first technology that has presented that opportunity to us absent a legal framework.\r\n\r\nRegardless of whether or not you agree: this seems orthogonal to \"open source\" vs. any alternative.\r\n\r\n> 8. The network effect would eventually push everyone to a single virtual world\r\n\r\nThis is a matter of imagination and active investigation for many groups and individuals in this space. In order for a network effect to play out, you must have established rules for the network. Not all networks centralize; many settle into a meta-stable state until disruptive forces change the status quo. In order to know for certain that a network will centralize, you must already have an architecture in mind for the network.\r\n\r\nRegardless of whether or not you agree: this seems orthogonal to \"open source\" vs. any alternative.\r\n\r\n> 9. AR and not VR will make the Metaverse mainstream\r\n\r\nThis isn't necessarily controversial to me, but it is very subjective.\r\n\r\nRegardless of whether or not you agree: this seems orthogonal to \"open source\" vs. any alternative.\r\n\r\n> 10. Distributed governance is necessary to limit censorship\r\n\r\nI think it helps, but also distributed governance can still result in tyranny depending on the details of the architecture.\r\n\r\nRegardless of whether or not you agree: this seems orthogonal to \"open source\" vs. any alternative.\r\n\r\n> 11. The Metaverse has the power to become a dystopian nightmare\r\n\r\nYes, but I would add that this applies to networked communications technology in general.\r\n\r\nRegardless of whether or not you agree: this seems orthogonal to \"open source\" vs. any alternative.\r\n\r\n> 12. Decentralization will not aide data protection\r\n\r\nThis needs more specifics in order for me to form an opinion: decentralization across what axis?\r\n\r\nThis seems orthogonal to \"open source\" vs. any alternative.\r\n\r\n> 13. Censorship is necessary to create community\r\n\r\nI don't necessarily disagree, but this seems orthogonal to \"open source\" vs. any alternative\r\n\r\n> 14. Open source may not be the answer\r\n\r\nI guess what I'm missing here is: what answer are you looking for?\r\n\r\nYou might be right, but points 1-13 seem like they would apply whether open source is part of the equation or not."},{"id":"DC_kwDOFUbqUM4AG7sn","author":{"login":"RedEagleP1"},"body":"> I don't agree that this is a given. https://hubs.mozilla.com/ is my favorite example of a multi-modal metaverse.

Previews etc. are separate, that would be dealt with via WebFinger as discussed, this would only be concerned with the lifecycle of transitioning you to another VWP in a standard VWP-agnostic way.\r\n\r\nAt first I was thinking of an omi://<world>//... protocol handler at the OS level, particularly for the aesthetics, but I don't think there's a way for the source VWP to get data back (for preview, dependency check, launch status etc.). Anyone know if that's possible? It does also seem more standards-friendly to me if so.\r\n\r\nAnother method is a basic localhost HTTP(S) protocol that allows the source VWP to query and/or launch into that target VWP's world by talking to a local agent.\r\n\r\nIdeas:\r\n\r\n- Standard HTTP localhost:XXX protocol on a registered IANA port, for all locally installed engines (and local browsers) to talk to\r\n- Helper could:\r\n- Check whether dependencies are met (VWP installed)\r\n- Bring target VWP to the foreground if already running, and communicate target world to an already-running background VWP\r\n- Or launch into the target VWP if not, using that targets method of passing in the target world URL\r\n- Could potentially suspend the source VWP once transitioned using Nyrna (https://github.com/Merrit/nyrna)\r\n- If not suspend, can provide feedback status to the source VWP on target VWP launch success so it can quiesce or exit\r\n- Can direct you to Installation page for the target VWP if not installed\r\n- Ships as a locally installed native OMI Helper App, which VWPs can optionally sidecar package\r\n- Tiny footprint, minimal core, few app updates, dynamic updates to registered world protocols pulled from OMI periodically (where it gets it's knowledge of how to launch the target world, deps etc.)\r\n- Could provide a beach head to expand into Constellation (future) for ease-of-installation of target VWPs/dependencies\r\n\r\nNote that the agent could bridge between the standard local OMI protocol adopted by the source VWP, and a target VWP's potentially proprietary method - it wouldn't necessarily need target VWP support.

I'm absolutely supportive of and\n> across Constellation (and love the new name, as we all do!) - just been\n> lurking due to time constraints. My only concern is with tying\n> Constellation too much to OS primitives (that only exist on Linux\n> presently), as I personally feel this will slow adoption and integration\n> for other platforms. As you mentioned, it's hard to identify real-world\n> useable integrations right now because the existing VWPs are closed boxes.\n> To me, that means making adoption as easy as possible (and compelling\n> enough to adopt) is imperative, and across all of their supported\n> platforms, target OSs and versions.\n>\n> Perhaps the above Helper becomes the middleware that leverages those OS\n> primitives by proxy, and/or shims equivalents where they don't exist? If OS\n> primitives don't exist pervasively, there is an argument to be made that we\n> should come up a layer, and use something like ZeroMQ or some other\n> cross-platform library to provide our IPC/pub-sub (is D-Bus providing us\n> with more functionality than this?). That way we could ship something\n> embeddable with minimal dependencies for the user.\n>\n> That all being said - re:a bit clunky, I get ya. My preference would\n> absolutely be a pure protocol approach (and also in keeping with OMIs\n> present goal of not building software). I'm not convinced it's possible at\n> present, because the primitives we need likely don't exist across all\n> targets (as always, happy to be proven wrong on this), but also because a\n> protocol-only approach pushes a larger burden onto the implementors, which\n> again may neuter adoption (and we are already up against the question of\n> why do they want to allow people to leave their cozy walled garden).\n>\n> So I suspect, either way, we end up delivering some software off of our\n> standards... if it's a reference implementation / library that makes the\n> OMI protocol more consumable that's a good thing IMHO. There's a caveat\n> that it's harder for us to evolve an embedded library once released. An\n> agent/service approach could become an important beach head for future OMI\n> innovation (and lerping into Constellation, ultimately). It needs to be\n> easy to adopt, and deliver enough value to the VWPs to cause them to adopt\n> right now, whilst these worlds are evolving rapidly.\n>\n> Removing a burden/overhead from VWPs in supporting myriad Virtual World\n> URIs seems like one of those value props, especially as somebody needs to\n> solve the \"oh I don't have that VWP installed\" problem. In danger of\n> drifting off-topic, but it's outside of OMIs remit at present to solve that\n> last part, it needs a Steam-esque (but open) approach IMHO.

Many of them are or can be interconnected. They also stem from my own attempts at creating my own corner of the metaverse via a project I had called '[Flubbi](https://www.flubbiverse.com/)' a digital playdough system geared towards solving/addressing depression, loneliness, and poverty through powerful creativity tools. It was way too ambitious for my skillset, but it allowed me to explore these idea of the metaverse far beyond typical (sensible) limits. \r\n\r\nMore importantly, I operated at a virtual reality arcade for over 3 years, and have been exploring the idea of XR and metaverse since elementary school. Working at the arcade allowed me to see what everyday people think about, have trouble with, and get excited about when they use this technology. From all of that and more I have thought about what would make the metaverse (or really the future of the internet) much more powerful, inclusive, and accessible. \r\n\r\nAnyways, please let me know which of these are things any of you might want to work on with me. Or if you have questions/feedback/resources and want to go into further detail. \r\n\r\nWithout further ado, here are some of my ideas:\r\n\r\n**Tools for creation** - Making it super easy (and fun) for non-technical and non-artistic people to create their own objects, avatars, and worlds. Something that goes beyond or at least is not _just_ one type of creative tool (like only using minecraft style or fortnite style or tilt brush style creation tools) so that people who prefer/are good at certain tools can find the one(s) that works best for them depending on their goals and skill level (ie meet them where they are, instead of forcing them to meet the tool where it is).\r\n\r\n**Tools for simulation** - Ability to create (somewhat) realistic, immersive simulations on-demand. They don't have to be realistic in all ways, just a few for different contexts. For example: \r\n- space simulations for mapping stars or understanding planet dynamics, this can be used for creating an AR app that allows you to see past light pollution to get a better idea of the real night sky you are missing. Or to create cool skyboxes, or for VR space travel experiences\r\n- biochemistry simulations for being able to visualize and communicate how vaccines work or how the immune system works; perhaps it can even show the dangers of microplastics, contaminated food/water, or the difference between good vs bad GMOs\r\n- urban planning simulations that allows you to see the difference between a walkable city and a car-dependent one, thereby showing how much more freedom one has in a walkable city as opposed to a suburban wasteland. It can also allow one to scan your own neighborhood/city and begin simulating what it would be like if it was designed differently (ie better)\r\n- physics simulations through either traditional physics-based engines or some sort of advanced voxel engines that can allow people to develop more interest sandbox games, or more interactive virtual worlds that you can explore in a headset or via traditional devices\r\n\r\n**Virtual homes** - Your home away from home. Similar to the first idea, but focusing on the ability to host and access this home from anywhere, on any device, regardless of platform. This will really show people the value of being able to 'own' your digital life. It can be a way to visually access your stored data, talk to people or create content outside of any platform and their terms of service, and fully express one's creativity without the limitations of any one platform or medium. This should eventually be able to replace a person's homepage, desktop, and mobile device home screen such that \r\n\r\n**RSS but for any/all media** - Related to the above, but specifically about the ability to have content come to you, on your terms, rather than having to go elsewhere. You can bring in any type of content from anywhere on the web and either host/store it locally or at least access it directly (via embedding, iframes, or similar technology) divorced from the source platform's ad engine or algorythm suggestions. The interface one uses to manage all of this content (subscribing/unsubscribing, favorites, categories, ratings, shares, comments/notes, etc) should all be very flexible as well. You can design the interface exactly how you want it, or download templates and skins from others and remix those if you like too. You can even share your curated lists or subscribe to other curated feeds. Furthermore, you can download open source plugins/addons that help manage this information or even highlight bias, filter bubbles, dark patterns, and inaccurate information.\r\n\r\n**Jailbreaker but for Interop** - Tool that can help you de-centralize yourself and break you out of closed gardens by porting all of your data (or as much as possible) from those places and into either your own hardware, p2p networks, or some other decentralized solution. Can walk you through the process or do it all automatically depending on your needs, budget, and source platform. The interface is similar to the above in that it is highly flexible, extensible, and accessible from any device or medium.\r\n\r\n**Directory of Interoperability** - This has been brought by myself and many others in the early days of this project, but I wanted to give more details on what this can look like. We need to have an extensive list showing all the various tools, projects, papers, people, worlds, and so on that more or less follow our ideals around being open and interoperable. I'm sure many people have already had many of these ideas I've shared, and may even have built them out a good amount, but its extremely difficult to find them and get involved. So I'd like to do my best to help figure out a great information architecture and interface to finding, interacting with, and sharing these initiatives. Ideally, this directory should be accessible to all kinds of people, at all levels of technical knowledge, on all kinds of devices, especially immersive ones.\r\nFor example, what if we made directories that were:\r\n\r\n- A 2D map, where you can see where to find everything in relation to others as if they were geographically located, this allows a somewhat easier way of remembering how to find information via spatial reasoning.\r\n- A 3D map, that is similar to the 2D map, except you can be immersed in the map and see the indubitably more complex connections that a digital network has.\r\n- A traditional directory, for all the folks that just want a simple list.\r\n- A 3D immersive directory, where you can take something simple like a list and organize it in a way that makes sense to you in 3D space. This allows the use of more types of navigation (ie portals, pages, links, images, etc) and the manipulation of metadata in really interesting ways (ie being able to connect information together in unexpected but intriguing ways)\r\n\r\n**Alt-Future Worlds** - This is more of an art/philosophy project to show people what it could look like to live in a different world. Too many people think that how things are today are just a 'necessary evil' or that anything else is 'unrealistic' or 'not practical'. But most of those people just suffer from a lack of knowledge on how things _were_ different and/or a lack of imagination on how things _can_ be different. Therefore, I'd like to help design different worlds (can be alt-history, positive scifi, or speculative fantasy), that help educate and inspire folks to think differently. Here are some ideas:\r\n\r\n- Anarchist societies - Showcasing what living in anarchic communities actually looks like, along with informational blurbs pulled from anthropological data and present-day activism. \r\n- Solarpunk - Visualizing environments from aesthetic themes all the way to functional worlds, ranging from existing solarpunk fiction to the ability to craft one's own world in this vein.\r\n- What if the world was never colonized - Alt-history worlds that show what it would be like to live in 'modern-day' aboriginal societies, explores the vast diversity in these societies from egalitarian foragers and cities to hegemonic, non-european empires.\r\n- Space exploration without colonization - Exploring far future possibilities that go far beyond current-day assumptions of what humans might do when we have the ability to travel interstellar space; things like building space habitats, dealing with ethical considerations of interventions vs stealthy cataloguing and so on.\r\n- The internet, but free - What would the internet look like if it wasn't monopolized by a few big tech companies? What if the original ideas of the internet that folks like Douglas Engelbart imagined.\r\n- Digital public parks - Using data from folks like Civic Signals, what would it look like to have online 'playgrounds' that are in the Commons?\r\n- Digital public libraries - Same as above, but for information/content sites. Also could be a modernization of current libraries\r\n- Aboriginal societies, the reality - A heavily data-backed visualization of what indigenous societies were most likely like before colonisation.\r\n- Hyperreality, non-dystopian version - Exploring what an ethical, well-designed, and positive 'hyperreality' could look like\r\n- Metaverse, the non-dystopian dream - Re-imagining the idea of the metaverse based on crowdfunded ideas of what people first dreamt about the concept after reading them from dystopian fiction such as the Matrix, Snowcrash, and Ready Player One.\r\n\r\n\r\nI know a lot of this is sort of wishlisting and is much harder to do IRL, also they are not all specifically about XR, but I think it is critical to develop these sorts of tools and ideas if we ever want to give as many people as possible a clear alternative to closed, data greedy platforms.

I like the idea, but I'm not so sure that we can get adoption of zero knowledge APIs. Currently my thoughts are that a trusted home server is your protected data storage. You grant permission to other servers/applications to access partial views of that data. Scopes would be pretty granular.\r\n\r\nThings like friends list access could even require a separate more serious permission method. Like, I would only want to give that permission to a browser extension / native app. It's more my client rather than an a third party application that gets access to a scoped view of my data.\r\n\r\n**This is a bigger discussion that we need to have as a group though.** Who do we want to implement homeservers? Who do we want to integrate this into their app? What data do they need? What level of privacy can we build in without making it such that nobody will adopt it because it doesn't fit with their existing application's architecture?\r\n\r\nYou've also mentioned doing most of this work client-side. I'd love a view into what that would look like. I like this idea a lot, but need to see how it compares with a primarily homeserver-based implementation.\r\n\r\nI'm super curious about this and have a bunch of questions. How does my wallet receive messages when I'm offline? Where does it store data? How does it sync between devices? Do we need a homeserver for this implementation? Is a homeserver just used for storage of encrypted data?\"_\r\n","author":{"login":"mrmetaverse"},"comments":{"nodes":[{"id":"MDE3OkRpc2N1c3Npb25Db21tZW50MTI0NjE5Mg==","author":{"login":"jorgenbuilder"},"body":"Software canisters on the Internet Computer blockchain might be a good medium for home servers."}]},"labels":{"nodes":[]}},{"id":"MDEwOkRpc2N1c3Npb24zNTM3Mzky","category":{"name":"Weekly Meetings"},"upvoteCount":1,"updatedAt":"2022-09-16T20:22:30Z","createdAt":"2021-08-24T18:51:15Z","number":79,"title":"8/25/2021 Weekly Meeting 18 Agenda","body":"Weekly Meeting 18 is happening on Wednesday 8/25/2021 from 9:00 AM PDT - 10:00 AM PDT\r\n\r\nYou can add it to your calendar [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/1?cid=Y18wZHB1Z2Y5ZjgzZXE0cWVrbWI2b21xYmptZ0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t).\r\n\r\nWe'll be meeting again in the omi-weekly-meeting channel of the [AngellXR Discord](https://discord.gg/NJtT9grz5E).\r\n\r\n## Agenda\r\n   - Welcome new members and attendance\r\n   - [OMI Survey](https://forms.gle/Dxvap4auBGim6JsL9)\r\n   - Working agreements / playbook follow-up\r\n   - Discord Role Bot (#roles in Discord)\r\n   - Website\r\n       - update on iterative development and release strategy\r\n       - call out for website section maintainers and community content\r\n   - glTF Sub Group\r\n       - progress updates\r\n       - call out for extension brainstorming [list](https://github.com/omigroup/gltf-extensions/discussions/7)\r\n       - Khronos 3D Formats Group Liaison\r\n   - Virtual World URIs / omi-world-metadata\r\n        - follow-ups from [2021.08.21 hack-together](https://discord.com/channels/770382203782692945/878654908549713970)\r\n   - World Exploration\r\n       - discoveries from [Tuesday's vket outing](https://discord.com/channels/770382203782692945/852608195972694067)\r\n   - Demo Night coordination follow-up\r\n     - https://forms.gle/CknpQQKNi7ywQu9u5\r\n\r\nAdd ons: \r\n  - ...","author":{"login":"humbletim"},"comments":{"nodes":[{"id":"MDE3OkRpc2N1c3Npb25Db21tZW50MTIzNDE1OA==","author":{"login":"mrmetaverse"},"body":"@humbletim and I were talking and eventually, we may want to look out our Main (formerly known as \"Master\") backlog at the end of our meetings.

I guess you could set room information to say that this is a friend room though.\r\nAnd yeah you can represent groups as rooms as well.\r\niFire — Yesterday at 13:44\r\nThere's the Japanese cultural concept of artist circles.\r\nRobert — Yesterday at 13:44\r\nAnd then to notfiy a user/group you'd send it to all of their mailboxes in activity pub or the room in matrix.\r\niFire — Yesterday at 13:45\r\nand each object is signed by a retractable signature! by default\r\nRobert — Yesterday at 13:45\r\nYup\r\nthey could even be encrypted in matrix\r\nActivityPub may have a standard for that as well idk\r\niFire — Yesterday at 13:48\r\nthe object signing should be acceptable by the blockchain crypto developers\r\nfor use in whatever tech they want to use\r\nmatrix signing for clarity is not on the blockchain\r\nwhich is what we promised we would do to not require blockchain like Eth or Bitcoin\r\nKoolala — Yesterday at 14:09\r\nI wouldn't really be worried about intention or if its named a chat room or a feed or a message or a post but I'm curious to see what the overlap is with matrix and actpub just in terms of identity and organized communication over time\r\niFire — Yesterday at 14:15\r\n@Robert does matrix has a webfinger http json equiv?\r\nRobert — Yesterday at 14:18\r\nIn what sense? Email -> MatrixID?\r\nhttps://matrix.org/docs/spec/identity_service/r0.3.0#email-associations\r\niFire — Yesterday at 14:19\r\nurl/MatrixID -> Name, GLB, Mailbox\r\nRobert — Yesterday at 14:19\r\nThat'd be this: https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.6.1#get-matrix-client-r0-profile-userid\r\nServer -> Server version: https://matrix.org/docs/spec/server_server/r0.1.4#get-matrix-federation-v1-query-profile\r\niFire — Yesterday at 14:23\r\nso in theory you can send me a matrix client http url for robert?\r\nRobert — Yesterday at 14:24\r\nhttps://matrix.org/_matrix/client/r0/profile/@arobertlong:matrix.org\r\niFire — Yesterday at 14:25\r\n{\"displayname\":\"Robert Long\",\"avatar_url\":\"mxc://matrix.org/YsMmlvGvDByojlKdmOVEcnGT\"}\r\nRobert — Yesterday at 14:25\r\nYup\r\nThat's it\r\nNow if I can add my glb avatar to it, then we're good to go\r\nI think that could be added to the spec and Synapse for sure\r\niFire — Yesterday at 14:26\r\nthere's private data section\r\nyou linked to it\r\n3.7   Profiles\r\n\r\nUsers may publish arbitrary key/value data associated with their account - such as a human readable display name, a profile photo URL, contact information (email address, phone numbers, website URLs etc).\r\n\r\n3.8   Private User Data\r\n\r\nUsers may also store arbitrary private key/value data in their account - such as client preferences, or server configuration settings which lack any other dedicated API. The API is symmetrical to managing Profile data.\r\nRobert — Yesterday at 14:27\r\nYeah, I'd need to look into that more. I haven't looked closely yet.\r\nKoolala — Yesterday at 14:29\r\nWhat parts of activitypub are you for sure confident of in their ability to overlap with Matrix? @Robert\r\nIn a standard way\r\nRobert — Yesterday at 14:31\r\nThey overlap in that they both can sync federated lists of events. Events which can be extended in similar ways. They both provide identity, but Matrix also specifies possible authentication models.\r\niFire — Yesterday at 14:32\r\nQ? is the avatar binary blob completely open like the open web, or do each platform need to get it via capabilities. which requires rooms\r\nRobert — Yesterday at 14:32\r\nKinda up to us to figure that out\r\nI could see either.\r\nIdk, lots of stuff to figure out.\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n</details>"},{"id":"MDE3OkRpc2N1c3Npb25Db21tZW50MTIwOTE2OQ==","author":{"login":"robertlong"},"body":"Thanks for posting this!

So for the gltf working group, or the upcoming stellar mesh working group, I recommend we draft working agreements that fit each teams. For example, we may have a working group consist mainly of people in Europe and they may want to establish standard working hours, or a standard toolset for workshops, etc. \r\n- Working agreements help strengthen team dynamics, and provide a psychologically safe place for all to participate. \r\n- Working agreements are also ideal for establish ceremony cadence, i.e. if your team wants to follow Scrum, you may want to establish a daily standup meeting time, a demo day, and a backlog refinement. But if your team doesn't want to use scrum, you may want to establish kanban or some other method of sharing and tracking work. \r\n- The most important part is that we should know how work gets done, how to get involved, and how to respect each other. \r\n- "},{"id":"MDE3OkRpc2N1c3Npb25Db21tZW50MTE1OTUzNw==","author":{"login":"mrmetaverse"},"body":"Notes for todays session are started here on [hackmd](https://hackmd.io/@mrmetaverse/omi-081121)"}]},"labels":{"nodes":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMzM2MTIxOTU0","name":"Consistently deliver value","color":"1B9AAA","description":"We incrementally discover and deliver  value with intent"}]}},{"id":"MDEwOkRpc2N1c3Npb24zNDg3NzY0","category":{"name":"Weekly Meetings"},"upvoteCount":1,"updatedAt":"2021-08-04T16:04:36Z","createdAt":"2021-07-28T18:18:02Z","number":71,"title":"8/4/2021 Weekly Meeting 15 Agenda","body":"Weekly Meeting 15 is happening on Wednesday 8/4/2021 from 9:00 AM PDT - 10:00 AM PDT\r\n\r\nYou can add it to your calendar [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/1?cid=Y18wZHB1Z2Y5ZjgzZXE0cWVrbWI2b21xYmptZ0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t).\r\n\r\nWe'll be meeting again in the omi-weekly-meeting channel of the [AngellXR Discord](https://discord.gg/NJtT9grz5E).\r\n\r\n## Agenda\r\n- W3C Working Group Chair Election #69 \r\n- OMI Weekly Meeting Discord Bot Update #63\r\n- OMI Website Update #49\r\n- OMI Virtual Space Update #44 \r\n  - World Building / Exploration Meetup #70\r\n- GLTF extensions sub-group update\r\n- Demo Day\r\n- Stellar Mesh #73\r\n\r\n## Add Ons\r\n*To add an agenda item please comment below*\r\n- Let's have a conversation about our mission and vision! #72","author":{"login":"robertlong"},"comments":{"nodes":[{"id":"MDE3OkRpc2N1c3Npb25Db21tZW50MTA4NDAzMg==","author":{"login":"mrmetaverse"},"body":"Hi everyone!

We would like to propose that a small team form to help plan the process for demo days where we will share our recent findings with each other. \r\n\r\nWe created [ticket #59](https://github.com/omigroup/OMI/issues/59) to kick off the planning. We have a number of questions before we can press play. For example:\r\n- how often should / can we meet? \r\n- how should we handle signing up to speak? \r\n- what is considered in and out of scope? \r\n- who can participate? \r\n- where do we document our findings for others? \r\n- is this actually going to be useful for our community? \r\n- how do we keep it lightweight and simple? This should be about sharing knowledge or recent lessons learned related to Interoperability, Open Source Metaverse, and OMI's work. _These are separate from lightning talks which can be about anything._ \r\n\r\nThis conversation could take up an entire meeting, so I propose that we form a small team and plan the process before setting a date.

Here are some of my notes:\r\n\r\nIdentity:\r\n- Fields in a person's profile should be able to be hidden unless made public. There was a discussion on whether or not visibility to friends is a good enough model for privacy.\r\n- Permission prompts that detail what profile fields are being collected were discussed as a good way of permitting using user data.\r\n- We discussed the possibility of avatars being represented as inventory items. Presumably the concepts of ownership, trading, and browsing them would be inherited from the inventory spec.\r\n- Permissions for viewing a certain avatar/item could be represented in the inventory spec, making sure that you can tag an avatar/item as private or not.\r\n- Avatars are often represented as multiple pieces, combined to form a single avatar. This could include different body styles, hair, clothing, and accessories. This could be stored as multiple glTF models and combined into a single one by engines. However, this is a pretty complex place to start and a single glTF/VRM model seems more achievable.\r\n- We need the ability to have multiple identities. People represent themselves differently in different contexts, they may also may identity as [plural](https://pluralityresource.org/plurality-information/) and may front as multiple identities.\r\n- It is incredibly important that identities cannot be publicly associated with each other if people wish for them to remain private. Protecting against fingerprinting is a difficult problem in XR where gait detection can accurately identify someone. While gait detection may be out of scope for an identity spec, we do need to keep fingerprinting and privacy in mind."}]},"labels":{"nodes":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMzM2MTIxOTU0","name":"Consistently deliver value","color":"1B9AAA","description":"We incrementally discover and deliver  value with intent"}]}},{"id":"MDEwOkRpc2N1c3Npb24zMzIyNjQ3","category":{"name":"General"},"upvoteCount":2,"updatedAt":"2021-12-30T13:13:15Z","createdAt":"2021-04-15T14:31:49Z","number":10,"title":"OKRs Q2 2021","body":"**EDIT: Date is set 05/05/21 6AM PDT and 6PM PDT:** \r\nGood morning. The OMI journey is both large in potential impact, and in contributors. We are looking to plan an OKR workshop to establish baseline Objectives and Key Results so that we may track our progress, as well as lay critical breadcrumbs for future contributors. \r\n\r\n**OKR's empower us with measurable goals**, however we are not expecting to achieve 100% of every OKR in a given quarter. OKRs encourage a flexible, and outcome driven mindset (rather than output driven). Our Objectives should tie directly to our overall vision, which I've taken a crack at crafting a first draft: _OMI's vision is to co-create an open set of standards for connecting the Metaverse. This includes it's users, stakeholders, and creators._ \r\n\r\nAngellXR is happy to facilitate this working session. We haven't set a date yet, and are still in planning. **Basically consider everything a draft, if you see an opportunity to improve something, please say something** \r\n\r\nWe can drop OKR related readings and updates in this discussion thread.

We made a lot of progress in our two sessions together. You can check out the Figjam space [here](https://www.figma.com/file/HcSUQRYUHjTcVyGIA0fu1u/OMi-OKR-Workshop-Part-II?node-id=0%3A1). [Figjam ](https://www.figma.com/figjam/)is a new collaborative whiteboard product from Figma.\r\n\r\nThe next step is to review our Objective statements. We made an effort to capture overarching themes from the thematic clusters we created in our workshop.  Please review and discuss, or if you have a suggestion for a great way to discuss each of these 5 themes in an organized way, please reach out! The 5 objective statements we have are as follows:\r\n\r\n**1. We collaborate to make the metaverse more human.**\r\n\r\n**2. We empower the people making the metaverse.** \r\n\r\n**3. We are creating a cooperative, sustainable culture of innovation.** \r\n\r\n**4. We incrementally deliver value, with intent.** \r\n\r\n**5. We must achieve resiliency through diversity, and freedom of choice.**\r\n\r\n![OKR-omiObjectiveDrafts](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63426722/117510531-3a011900-af5a-11eb-8d0d-f17581e0165a.png)\r\n\r\nKeep in mind, we are looking for _high level_, and _measurable_ objectives. Once we agree on a core set of objectives, we will begin describing how we know if we have achieved (or how we are progressing towards) an objective. Specific tactics, or \"_hows_,\" and best practices most likely do not apply at this level. Those important concepts will apply at the execution level of these strategies and the tactics that are formed to achieve these objectives. \r\n\r\nWe are also not looking for perfection. OKRs are not meant to be achieved 100%. If we score **.6** on a scale of  **0.0 - 1.0**, that is pretty good! We will revisit and refine our objectives every 3-4 months, and artifacts like our formal vision statement, and roadmap, will be informed by these high level goals we set as a fledgling organization. \r\n\r\nPlease explore, and give these concepts great consideration. Is there something we are missing, or that can be refined? Do these make you feel inspired? \r\n\r\nThank you for your commitment to this adventure together. \r\n\r\nFor more information on OKR's check out \"Measure What Matters: OKRs: The Simple Idea that Drives 10x Growth,\"\r\n by John Doerr, or this article here: [link]( https://www.whatmatters.com/faqs/okr-meaning-definition-example/#:~:text=The%20definition%20of%20%E2%80%9COKRs%E2%80%9D%20is,encourage%20engagement%20around%20measurable%20goals \r\n)\r\n\r\n"},{"id":"MDE3OkRpc2N1c3Npb25Db21tZW50NzQ1ODQy","author":{"login":"mrmetaverse"},"body":"Update: OKR's are now assembled in a single doc, and I am working on language now.

Thank you to those that came out for our OKR workshop last week! It was totally worth waking up at 5:00 AM PDT for :sweat_smile: \r\n\r\nIf you missed the last meeting, we came up with these objectives for OMI:\r\n\r\n1. We collaborate to make the metaverse more human.\r\n\r\n2. We empower the people making the metaverse.\r\n\r\n3. We are creating a cooperative, sustainable culture of innovation.\r\n\r\n4. We incrementally deliver value, with intent.\r\n\r\n5. We must achieve resiliency through diversity, and freedom of choice.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1753624/117747633-6075bd00-b1c3-11eb-9e3e-56dc25c4b682.png)\r\n\r\nThis meeting wasn't recorded, but you can check out the full FigJam project [here](https://www.figma.com/file/HcSUQRYUHjTcVyGIA0fu1u/OMi-OKR-Workshop-Part-II?node-id=0%3A1).\r\n\r\n## Agenda\r\n\r\nWeekly Meeting 3 is happening on Wednesday 5/12/2021 from 9:00 AM PDT - 10:00 AM PDT\r\n\r\nYou can add it to your calendar [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/1?cid=Y18wZHB1Z2Y5ZjgzZXE0cWVrbWI2b21xYmptZ0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t).\r\n\r\nWe'll be meeting again in the omi-weekly-meeting channel of the [AngellXR Discord](https://discord.gg/NJtT9grz5E).\r\n\r\nWe will be finishing our OKRs by defining key metrics for each of the 5 objectives. After that we'll go into our scope of work and discussing our proposal process.\r\n\r\nAfter this meeting is the part where people get to start to start submitting their ideas for interoperability protocols and we get to figure out how we can start working together.

How do we get people involved in OMI and keep them involved? It's a lot of work to develop specifications, lead meetings, and build prototypes. Why are we doing this? Why should we expect others to contribute? Are there financial incentives or is it more about shaping what we as a group think is the future we want to live in?\r\n\r\nJin also expressed interest in having a meeting in discord to discuss this synchronously. I think we should do that, but let's kick it off here and schedule and ad-hoc meeting so we can get into the nitty-gritty for those who are interested.\r\n\r\nI'll start with why I'm involved. I'm doing this work because I think we need to from a moral perspective but also a financial perspective. I'd like to ensure that we are creating a new view into the internet that feels humane, not some dystopian view of cyberspace depicted in sci-fi novels. I'm also doing this work, because I want to work on projects in this space that would benefit from a more connected, open ecosystem rather than siloed, closed ones. I expect that is very similar to a lot of people in this group. I won't receive direct monetary gain from participating in these specifications, but the projects I'd like to work on can exist if we write them.\r\n\r\nThe larger players in this space are trying to establish their closed ecosystems where they set the rules and can push competitors out. In order for all our smaller projects to succeed, we need to work together. The network effects that we will receive from interoperability will lift us all up. I've already seen this with glTF. If your project can import/export glTF then you now have access to a massive content library. We need to continue creating interoperability points for identity and social systems so that the friction of joining our worlds and finding our friends goes down.\r\n\r\nAs to the the financial cost of participating in OMI, I get that these things take time. Each member will need to determine how much time they can realistically allocate to participating in our work. However, in many standards groups, you pay for membership. This is also a political group, we need to recognize that businesses are working together towards specifications, but we may also be competing for each-other's business. Co-operatition is a good thing! In our process, we will make many small decisions that could have huge effects on participants projects. Participating in OMI is exchanging time for influence. I mean all of this in the least cut-throat way possible, I think we're in this together for a set of shared goals, but if you need incentives, they are definitely already there.","author":{"login":"robertlong"},"comments":{"nodes":[{"id":"MDE3OkRpc2N1c3Npb25Db21tZW50NzI0ODYy","author":{"login":"madjin"},"body":"Thanks a bunch for getting this thread started! I've written about my personal motivations and why I'm involved here in this blog post if interested: https://hackmd.io/@XR/motivation\r\n\r\n[M3](https://github.com/m3-org/charter) had very similar goals and practices as OMI. As a founding member I helped to organize dozens of events with lightning talks (VODs: https://www.youtube.com/c/Exokit/videos), cross-platform field trips, and take notes for everything.\r\n\r\nMy experience of running M3 while also participating in web3 projects and DAOs has given me a unique perspective on how to structure mission driven communities to be more effective. This will be the subject of a future blog post, for now I'll share a few ideas in regards to this discussion:\r\n\r\n**How do we get people involved in OMI and keep them involved?**\r\n\r\nHaving skin in the game is essential. As you mentioned even standards groups require membership dues. Many of the groups participating in w3c are companies which by extension are all value aligned themselves.\r\n\r\nIn M3 there was no shortage of amazing ideas that emerged from our discussions, what we needed is more coordination on execution. Shared ownership as a brand or organization brings about a sense of responsibility in fulfilling whatever role the member can do.\r\n\r\n**Treasury**\r\n\r\nMembership dues can go into a treasury for the organization. Having a treasury plays a role in coordinating the community. People can buy other members time in order to collaborate on a needed feature or more broadly for the promotion of our ideas.\r\n\r\n**Recommendations**\r\n\r\n- Keep track of the things people do\r\n  - Can setup a discord channel (#did-a-thing)\r\n- Decide on membership fees\r\n  - Per month, season, annual, or lifetime\r\n  - Anything is better than $0\r\n- Outline paths to earn your way in\r\n  - Note taking during meetings\r\n  - Setting up a website\r\n  - Designing swag / flyers\r\n  - Contributing towards an OKR\r\n\r\n**Crypto**\r\n\r\nBlockchains are full of coordination games centered around shared data layers and open source software. Here's some recommended actions for easy ways for us to participate.\r\n\r\n- Invite the NFT discord bot\r\n  - We can mint/send tokens for free without needing to setup wallets\r\n  - Tokens can represent achievements, tickets, or swag\r\n  - It's been purpose built for organizations like OMI\r\n- Matrix bridge Discord to Webaverse / Metafactory\r\n  - Comms with communities implementing similar things\r\n- Consider setting up a [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/) page\r\n  - Gitcoin Grants like crypto-style patreon, overall ~20M in results\r\n  - Members can receive tips, projects can receive donations\r\n  - Web3 / NFT projects are deeply invested in metaverse interop\r\n    - Community that will champion us in public\r\n\r\n"}]},"labels":{"nodes":[]}},{"id":"MDEwOkRpc2N1c3Npb24zMzU5NjU2","category":{"name":"General"},"upvoteCount":1,"updatedAt":"2021-05-11T02:07:26Z","createdAt":"2021-05-11T00:25:28Z","number":30,"title":"W3C Metaverse Interoperability Community Group Charter","body":"This is a placeholder for discussing and drafting up our community charter.

However, we haven't really had a discussion around how we can engage our whole community. For those people who don't want to participate in technical discussions around protocols/standards, how can we make OMI a home for prototyping, research, and thoughtful discussion?\r\n\r\n@jsealt and I have talked about having three different meetings:\r\n\r\n1. Weekly W3C Community Group Meetings:\r\nThese meetings will be for discussing technical specifications for interoperability. We may split these up into meetings for each topic we're working on if they get to be too busy, but for now there will be one for all topics.\r\n\r\n2. Bi-weekly Community Meetups:\r\nThe agenda for these meetings would be a community status update, an informal show-and-tell session, and a social gathering for anyone involved in metaverse projects. @madjin worked on a similar thing called Metaverse Makers Meetup (M3) that held meetings in various virtual worlds and celebrated metaverse makers. I'd like OMI to be able to continue this tradition.\r\n\r\n3. Monthly Lightning Talks\r\nWe have a ton of people in our community working on amazing projects and with interesting backgrounds. This meeting would be a chance to feature them and educate our community on related topics.\r\n\r\nAside from these meetings, I think we need to discuss other ways we might want to work together as a community. Are there areas of research that we should be looking into? Are reference implementations of specifications enough open source work for OMI to house, or do people want to work on other types of projects? Should AngellXR house these efforts? @jsealt has expressed that Angell was basically set up for these sorts of projects. Also, do we need to create a separate non-profit organization from the W3C community group to fund research and development?\r\n\r\nIncreasing the scope of OMI comes with a cost. Managing an organization focused on standards/protocols is already a lot of work. I've heard a lot of interest for us to do more, but what can we realistically accomplish that will make OMI a great home for metaverse creators?","author":{"login":"robertlong"},"comments":{"nodes":[]},"labels":{"nodes":[]}},{"id":"MDEwOkRpc2N1c3Npb24zMzM3ODM5","category":{"name":"Q&A"},"upvoteCount":1,"updatedAt":"2021-05-06T17:27:04Z","createdAt":"2021-04-26T04:59:14Z","number":20,"title":"When is the next meeting?","body":"Just poked around to make sure I don’t miss the next meeting.

Sunday's inaugural meeting was a huge success! We had over 35 attendees! I did not expect this level of interest this early, so thank you to everyone who showed up!\r\n\r\n## Summary of the last meeting:\r\n\r\nThe meeting focused on getting to know each other, trying to define the \"Open Metaverse\", and figuring out how we want to organize ourselves.\r\n\r\nThere's a recording available here: \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3mFHxv9CNQ\r\n\r\nAnd @madjin took notes which are available here:\r\nhttps://hackmd.io/@XR/omi-1\r\n\r\n## Action items from the meeting:\r\n\r\n- Establish a GitHub organization for discussion and spec work (This org)\r\n- Set up a Matrix room and bridges to existing Discord communities (I'm still working on this)\r\n- Further investigate how we should organize ourselves and how we can work with/within existing organizations (W3C, DIF, Khronos, Matrix, etc.)\r\n  - Gather information about W3C Community Groups\r\n  - Determine if we can work with or be a part of an existing group \r\n  - Determine options for IP Protection\r\n- Organize and present the data from the OMI Survey\r\n- Schedule the next meeting based on the Doodle survey results\r\n\r\n## Next Steps\r\n\r\nOver the last week I've been speaking with different people involved in various W3C groups including @cwilso, @TrevorFSmith, @humbletim, and @dmitrizagidulin. I also attended the W3C Credentials Community Group's weekly meeting to get a sense for what they are working on there.\r\n\r\nI received multiple recommendations for us to start our our own W3C Community Group. I think this is likely the best option for us. I did talk to @TrevorFSmith and @cwilso about possibly joining up with the W3C Immersive Web Community Group, but they are focused on lower-level browser API specifications such as WebXR, lighting estimation, hand tracking, etc. There is likely a lot that we can collaborate on, but it would be best for us to do this work in our own group with a sole focus on metaverse-related specifications.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about W3C Community Groups [here](https://www.w3.org/community/about/faq/).\r\n\r\nI'd like to propose that we create a W3C Metaverse Interoperability Community Group for the purposes of developing specifications, holding discussions, and developing reference implementations.\r\n\r\nThe first step of this process is proposing a group on the [W3C website](https://www.w3.org/community/groups/propose_cg/):\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1753624/114951721-d4fa4d80-9e09-11eb-8901-bcd5fccf1232.png)\r\n\r\nWe will need to decide on a name, description, and short name for the group.\r\n\r\nFive individuals will then need to provide their support to the proposal by creating a W3C account and voting on their site. Pending W3C's approval we will then get a launch date for our group when we will be given access to the W3C Community Group infrastructure.\r\n\r\nWe will also need to nominate and vote on one or more community group chairs. These individuals will be responsible for making sure the group fulfills the [W3C's community group requirements](https://www.w3.org/community/about/process/#operational-agreements) as well as any of our group's operational agreements which we will also need to determine. There's a process for chair selection documented [here](https://w3c.github.io/cg-charter/CGCharter.html#chairs), but ultimately it's up to us to choose our own chairs.\r\n\r\nContributors to specifications will need to sign the [W3C Community Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://www.w3.org/community/about/process/cla/). This grants W3C royalty-free license to your individual contributions. You can read more about the IP protections [here](https://www.w3.org/community/about/process/#patents).\r\n\r\nYou also cannot participate in a community group anonymously. You must have an identity in the community and follow the [W3C Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/). That also applies to all of our communications channels.\r\n\r\nSo, with all of that said. What will the activities of this group look like? We will propose and discuss specification work in this Github repository via Github issues. Specifications will get their own repository. Long form discussion, Q&A, and other topics dealing with public administrative work can happen in Github Discussions. We also will have both a public/private mailing list provided to us by W3C. I'd personally like to use these sparingly beyond meeting agendas, notes, and reminders. I'd opt for using github discussions and issues instead. Realtime communication will happen in our Matrix room, which I am still in the process of setting up due to our unique bridging requirements. Until then, we will continue meeting in the [AngellXR Discord](https://discord.gg/bnkTMCaRQe).\r\n\r\nSpecification and implementation repositories are something we can discuss in detail later. I still need some guidance on this, but I'll wait until we've decided on this group or not before we continue.\r\n\r\ntldr; A W3C Community Group gives us a formal spec process, credibility when talking to larger companies, an IP protection framework that's already well understood and accepted by companies, and a bunch of resources that we can use.\r\n\r\nI'd like to talk more about this here asynchronously so that everyone gets a chance to participate. I'd also like to schedule our next meeting where we can wrap up these discussions on the call.\r\n\r\nBased off the Doodle Survey results, it looks like people are most available in the following time slots:\r\n- Sundays 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM Pacific Time\r\n- Sundays 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM Pacific Time\r\n- Mondays 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM Pacific Time\r\n- Mondays 12:00 PM - 1:00 PM Pacific Time\r\n- Mondays 4:00 PM - 5:00 PM Pacific Time\r\n- Mondays 5:00 PM - 6:00 PM Pacific Time\r\n- Wednesdays 8:00 AM - 9:00 AM Pacific Time\r\n- Wednesdays 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM Pacific Time\r\n- Wednesdays 4:00 PM - 5:00 PM Pacific Time\r\n- Thursdays 4:00 PM - 5:00 PM Pacific Time\r\n- Thursdays 5:00 PM - 6:00 PM Pacific Time\r\n- Thursdays 6:00 PM - 7:00 PM Pacific Time\r\n- Fridays 8:00 AM - 9:00 AM Pacific Time\r\n- Fridays 12:00 PM - 1:00 PM Pacific Time\r\n- Fridays 1:00 PM - 2:00 PM Pacific Time\r\n- Fridays 2:00 PM - 3:00 PM Pacific Time\r\n- Saturdays 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM Pacific Time\r\n- Saturdays 1:00 PM - 2:00 PM Pacific Time\r\n\r\nWe had 17 participants in that poll and it didn't narrow down the results enough so I'm going to create another with just these times.\r\n\r\n# You can vote for the timeslots [here](https://doodle.com/poll/xt9b9t9zpwg7qkr9)\r\n\r\nSo now let's discuss this W3C Working Group Proposal, any objections, and the details for the proposal (name, shortname, description).\r\n\r\nThanks again for getting involved everyone!","author":{"login":"robertlong"},"comments":{"nodes":[{"id":"MDE3OkRpc2N1c3Npb25Db21tZW50NjE5MDQ5","author":{"login":"yangwao"},"body":"AngellXR Discord invite seems invalid )"},{"id":"MDE3OkRpc2N1c3Npb25Db21tZW50NjI1NTU3","author":{"login":"robertlong"},"body":"I'm about ready to close the availability poll for the next meeting.

I also think we can better accomplish things asynchronously here before the next meeting.\r\n\r\nOur agenda for Friday will be to take a vote on forming this W3C Community Group, we also need to schedule a date and time for the [OKR workshop](https://github.com/omigroup/OMI/discussions/10).\r\n\r\nHere's what we need:\r\n\r\n- If you are in opposition to forming this W3C Community Group, please state your reasons and any alternatives.\r\n- For the W3C Community Group Application we need:\r\n  - A group name\r\n  - A short group name used in urls/mailing lists\r\n  - A description of the group that briefly explains our scope of work.\r\n    - For example the Immersive Web Community Group's is:\r\n      > Our goal is to help bring high-performance Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality to the open Web.\r\n- Proposals for additional meeting agenda items. This is going to be a 1 hour meeting so please be conscious of the time. We'll try to get though as many things as we can.\r\n\r\nHere's my proposal:\r\n\r\n#### Group Name:\r\nMetaverse Interoperability Group\r\n#### Short Name:\r\nmetaverse-interop\r\n#### Description:\r\nOur mission is to bridge virtual worlds by designing and promoting protocols for identity, social graphs, inventory, and more."},{"id":"MDE3OkRpc2N1c3Npb25Db21tZW50NjMyNTY2","author":{"login":"robertlong"},"body":"Ok the final time for the meeting will be Friday, April 23rd 12:00 PM - 1:00 PM PDT.\r\n\r\nWe'll be meeting in Discord voice in the [AngellXR server](https://discord.gg/JRC8CvBUwR)."},{"id":"MDE3OkRpc2N1c3Npb25Db21tZW50NjM0MzEw","author":{"login":"yangwao"},"body":"ooo, noted in calendar!\nMay show up as it's 9 pm CEST\nThank you for organizing this!\n\nOn Tue, Apr 20, 2021 at 12:25 AM Robert Long ***@***.***>\nwrote:\n\n> Ok the final time for the meeting will be Friday, April 23rd 12:00 PM -\n> 1:00 PM PDT.\n>\n> We'll be meeting in Discord voice in the AngellXR server\n> <https://discord.gg/JRC8CvBUwR>.\n>\n> —\n> You are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/omigroup/OMI/discussions/11#discussioncomment-632566>,\n> or unsubscribe\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ABM5POI4LPEAQ2DBHTFLOXDTJSUXPANCNFSM43AQY7AA>\n> .\n>\n"}]},"labels":{"nodes":[]}},{"id":"MDEwOkRpc2N1c3Npb24zMzIxNzg4","category":{"name":"Ideas"},"upvoteCount":1,"updatedAt":"2022-07-06T16:31:56Z","createdAt":"2021-04-15T01:59:35Z","number":8,"title":"Interoperable GLTF extensions (including those like VRM)?","body":"This seems like a complex topic.. for now just raw transcript of 2021.04.14 #omi-general discussion regarding the possibility of leveraging VRM, GLTF, GLTF extensions for interoperability:\r\n\r\n**[5:43 PM]** **humbletim**:  how does VRM articulate their extensions on top of GLTF? (maybe that can be a reference point for capturing relevant XRPK extensions to WEBN?)\r\n**[5:46 PM]** **Robert**:  Well, they chose to create a superset of glTF with a separate file extension. But the underlying format is (as far as I know) just glTF with their extension `VRMC_vrm`\r\n**[5:46 PM]** **Robert**:  https://github.com/vrm-c/vrm-specification/tree/master/specification/VRMC_vrm-1.0_draft\r\n**[5:47 PM]** **Robert**:  It looks like there are some dependencies on other extensions as well:\r\nhttps://github.com/vrm-c/vrm-specification/tree/master/specification/VRMC_vrm-1.0_draft#dependencies\r\n**[5:48 PM]** **Robert**:  This is what glTF extensions look like:\r\nhttps://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/extensions\r\n**[5:48 PM]** **Robert**:  It's just a namespaced object underneath the extensions property on supported nodes of the json tree.\r\n**[5:48 PM]** **Robert**:  And then you write a spec and JSON Schema\r\n**[5:50 PM]** **Robert**:  Namespaces are prefixed by KHR for Khronos extensions, EXT for multi-vendor extensions, or any other registered prefix for vendor specific extensions.\r\n**[5:52 PM]** **Robert**:  Not all vendor specific extensions are published in that repository. But if you want others to be able to use it, you submit it for review and get it ratified. Vendor extensions typically need very little effort, versus EXT or KHR extensions which can take a while. EXT or KHR generally signal stability and wider support so the working group takes care to get the spec right.\r\n**[5:56 PM]** **Robert**:  One of the things I'd like to propose is standardizing `MOZ_hubs_components` for wider use. Basically its an extension for describing runtime behaviors of glTF nodes. I'd like to revisit how it's done, but I think it'd be an easy way to define common scene, avatar, and object behaviors.\r\n**[5:57 PM]** **Robert**:  Paired with a standardized sandboxed scripting API you could use it to describe custom behaviors not defined in the spec.\r\n**[5:59 PM]** **Robert**:  Scripts could be WASM or JS based and work well in web browsers with reasonable performance or integrated into native apps with a JS/WASM engine.\r\n**[6:01 PM]** **Robert**:  I've generally seen XRPK as an alternative to this, but now I realize it could be more of a packaging format for something like this. Whether you need that over just packing everything into a .glb Idk.\r\n**[6:03 PM]** **humbletim**:  just curious but are those MOZ_ extensions related to how Spoke would bundle everything up into a monolithic .glb?\r\n**[6:03 PM]** **Robert**:  Yeah, that was the system I came up with for our asset pipeline. It's paired with a custom glTF loader in Hubs.\r\n**[6:04 PM]** **Robert**:  We also have tooling for blender\r\n**[6:04 PM]** **Robert**:  https://github.com/MozillaReality/hubs-blender-exporter\r\n**[6:07 PM]** **Robert**:  The general concept works pretty well. I think standardizing behaviors across multiple apps is a place to improve though. A lot of the work is specific to Hubs.\r\n**[6:08 PM]** **Robert**:  We also never did the scripting API. Something I really wanted to work on, but never was able to due to shifting priorities.\r\n\r\n... link to discussion on discord: [2021.04.14 AngellXR#omi-general discussion](https://discord.com/channels/770382203782692945/830454514682167356/832008285069639691) ","author":{"login":"humbletim"},"comments":{"nodes":[]},"labels":{"nodes":[]}},{"id":"MDEwOkRpc2N1c3Npb24zMzIxNjI0","category":{"name":"Ideas"},"upvoteCount":1,"updatedAt":"2022-08-08T20:24:17Z","createdAt":"2021-04-14T22:57:55Z","number":7,"title":"XRPackage (XRPK) notes","body":"XRPK has been suggested as a good starting point for having an interoperable asset format.\r\n\r\nBelow is my attempt to capture some key takeaways from current discussions along with links to online reference materials.\r\n\r\n(from the documentation:)\r\n> An XRPackage is a bundle of files.
