Discord can be a black hole for information, users don't tend to come to RocketChat (too intimidating), developers don't come to Reddit (not specific enough).

Ultimately we need to support both use cases, because we want to allow as much as possible to be edited as close to the source as possible (ex: in Blender, and exported to glTF), but also not everything can be done that way."}]},"labels":{"nodes":[]}}]}}}}
