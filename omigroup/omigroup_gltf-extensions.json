Regarding which nodes are legal to connect.\r\n\r\n**Four Joint connect cases discussed:** \r\n1.) node is ref node not part of rigidbody - what do we do??? equal to connecting to a static. Example is a body being anchored to a location. Like a balloon attached to a fixed point. That fixed point would be a node not part of the rigid. \r\n2.) is a rigidbody -ez to connect two of these\r\n3.) descendent of rigidbody - relative to the rigidbody\r\n4.) can it be attached to null? No. We identified that you must connect to something be it a static node or another body.\r\n\r\nWe noted that Microsoft spec also has the concept of motors in joints to provide animation to the joints. They are called \"joint drive\"\r\n"},{"id":"DC_kwDOFwL-vM4AfL3r","author":{"login":"antpb"},"body":"We discussed how character controllers are unique cases that sometimes result in weird states where bodies may change type or be dynamic in ways that are hard to factor in.

Some historical reasoning behind the decision to rename `OMI_audio_emitter` to `KHR_audio` can be found here: https://github.com/omigroup/gltf-extensions/pull/73\r\n\r\nTLDR reasoning it was renamed in the past: \r\n\r\n> The extension has been renamed from OMI_audio_emitter to KHR_audio. KHR_audio both reflects the intent for this to be an official Khronos ratified extension and a more general audio extension to form the basis for additional extensions to provide features such as audio mixing, animation/one shot triggering of clips, additional audio format support, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was general agreement that it should be KHR_audio_emitter\r\n\r\nKHR recommendation for naming extensions can be found here: https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/main/extensions#naming\r\n\r\nThe recommendation is to use KHR_scope_action so in our recommendation it makes sense that audio_emitter is the scope and action.\r\n\r\n> Names SHOULD be structured as <PREFIX>_<scope>_<feature>, where scope is an existing glTF concept (e.g. mesh, texture, image) and feature describes the functionality being added within that scope. This structure is recommended, but not required.\r\n"},{"id":"DC_kwDOFwL-vM4AaPxe","author":{"login":"antpb"},"body":"I mentioned a need for the MSFT proposed extensions to be renamed to follow the scope and action suggestion in KHR extension naming.  @antpb to open an issue.\r\n\r\nCurrently there is `KHR_collision_shapes` (which has the same issue as the `materials` plural extension) \r\n\r\nand there is `KHR_rigid_bodies` which probably shouldn't break up the word and also be `scope_action`.\r\n\r\nSuggestion `KHR_physics_body` and `KHR_physics_shape`"}]},"labels":{"nodes":[]}},{"id":"D_kwDOFwL-vM4AVBAD","category":{"name":"General"},"upvoteCount":1,"updatedAt":"2023-08-11T01:25:07Z","createdAt":"2023-08-10T21:53:26Z","number":184,"title":"OMI glTF Working Group Meeting 08/10/23","body":"This meeting is on 08/10/2023 at 9:30 PM (UTC) / 2:30 PM (PST) in the [OMI Discord](https://discord.gg/NJtT9grz5E) within the #omi-weekly-meeting channel.
