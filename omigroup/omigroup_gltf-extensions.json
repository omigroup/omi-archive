An idea here is to imagine that journey from idea to artifact in just four one-hour sessions. Each session is meant to deliver a tangible outcome, so even if people only attend one or two, they leave with something concrete.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal is to create a low-friction, high-value way to \"practice\" the glTF extension lifecycle, demystifying the process and hopefully providing a launchpad for more sustained efforts.\r\n\r\nBelow is a rough, first-cut of what that could look like.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Proposed 4-Week Sprint Outline\r\n\r\nThe chosen \"toy\" extension for this sprint is `OMI_node_metadata`, designed for maximum simplicity to keep the focus on the *process*, not complex technical details.\r\n\r\n#### **Week 1: The Spark - From Zero to a Concrete Idea**\r\n* **Topic:** What is a glTF extension, really?\r\n* **Activity:** A 5-minute deconstruction of an existing simple extension to identify the key parts (spec, schema, example). Then, collaboratively write a one-paragraph proposal for our `OMI_node_metadata` concept.\r\n* **Outcome:** A shared document with a clear, concise proposal.\r\n\r\n#### **Week 2: The Blueprint - Creating the Schema**\r\n* **Topic:** Defining the \"rules\" for our extension in a machine-readable way.\r\n* **Activity:** A brief intro to JSON Schema, followed by a live, group-editing session to create the `OMI_node_metadata.schema.json` file. We'll use an online validator to check our work.\r\n* **Outcome:** A valid schema file that formally defines our extension's data.\r\n\r\n#### **Week 3: The Proof - Hacking a Live glTF**\r\n* **Topic:** Making it real by creating a tangible asset. This is the \"Aha!\" moment.\r\n* **Activity:** As a group, manually edit a simple `.gltf` file in a text editor to add the necessary `extensionsUsed` fields and the `OMI_node_metadata` data block to a node.\r\n* **Outcome:** A valid glTF model that contains our custom extension data.\r\n\r\n#### **Week 4: The Story & The Next Step**\r\n* **Topic:** Documenting what we did and gauging interest for the future.\r\n* **Activity:** Collaboratively write a \"micro-spec\" (`README.md`) that summarizes the extension and shows an example. The second half of the session would be a retrospective and a call to action to see who might be interested in a longer, more in-depth program.\r\n* **Outcome:** A complete \"pilot program package\" (proposal, schema, example, summary) and a clear path to gauge interest for a larger initiative.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThis is just a starting point for discussion. Would love to hear initial thoughts from the group:\r\n\r\n* Does this 4-week structure feel like a practical and valuable \"sampler\"?\r\n* Would this be an engaging way to learn the ropes of extension development?\r\n* Any suggestions on the activities or the proposed \"toy\" extension?\r\n","author":{"login":"humbletim"},"comments":{"nodes":[]},"labels":{"nodes":[]}},{"id":"D_kwDOFwL-vM4AeyNS","category":{"name":"General"},"upvoteCount":1,"updatedAt":"2025-03-12T06:55:36Z","createdAt":"2025-03-12T06:55:35Z","number":247,"title":"OMI glTF Working Group Meeting 2025-03-13","body":"This meeting is on 2025-03-13 at 16:00 UTC / 9:00 AM PDT in the [OMI Discord](https://discord.gg/J4vyAWFgkj) within the \"Weekly Meeting\" voice channel.
