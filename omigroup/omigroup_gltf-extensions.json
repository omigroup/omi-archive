Discord can be a black hole for information, users don't tend to come to RocketChat (too intimidating), developers don't come to Reddit (not specific enough). Forums would be great but unfortunately the world has migrated away from forums and we've lost something here."},{"id":"DC_kwDOFwL-vM4Aq85t","author":{"login":"aaronfranke"},"body":"We discussed the different workflows of importing glTF files into game engines, including the different perspectives of Khronos and other glTF folk who want the glTF to be a read-only last-mile format, in contrast to users of game engines who want to modify things after import. Ultimately we need to support both use cases, because we want to allow as much as possible to be edited as close to the source as possible (ex: in Blender, and exported to glTF), but also not everything can be done that way."}]},"labels":{"nodes":[]}},{"id":"D_kwDOFwL-vM4AcGDZ","category":{"name":"General"},"upvoteCount":1,"updatedAt":"2024-10-24T21:40:37Z","createdAt":"2024-10-24T21:37:48Z","number":236,"title":"OMI glTF Working Group Meeting 2024-10-24","body":"This meeting is on 2024-10-24 at 21:30 UTC / 2:30 PM PDT in the [OMI Discord](https://discord.gg/J4vyAWFgkj) within the \"Weekly Meeting\" voice channel.
